A decade after releasing his first solo album, Frank Turner gathers his favorite songs from 10 years of impassioned folk-punk. From a roaring paean to the mosh pit (“Four Simple Words”) to bittersweet reflections on ill-fated romance (“Mittens”), the first half is a best-of collection marked by the intensity, craft, and melody that’s made Turner an arena headliner. <i>Songbook</i>’s second part presents old songs in new forms. Some are simply revitalized, others completely reimagined—including the transformation of “Glorious You” from a fuzzy rocker into a tender ballad.

| Notes | This submission accommodates the first batch of the reissued half-speed remastered red vinyl.  These were incorrectly supplied in the same gatefold sleeve as the half-speed remastered black 180gm vinyl [r=17618050] using the same catalogue # BMGCAT403LP on the spine and back of the sleeve. The incorrect batch also used the same barcode 4 050538 625325 as the 180gm edition; however, obscured with a barcode sticker: 4 050538 625332 >  This oversight has now been corrected by replacing the gatefold sleeve printed with the correct catalogue # for the red edition; BMGCAT403CLP & barcode 4 050538 625332 [r=18198031].

An 8 song album, pressed on standard Black LP Vinyl, with printed inner sleeve - This album includes the full acoustic album that was recorded by Paddy McAloon in the summer of 2006 and released as part of the 2007 Legacy Double CD edition of ' Steve McQueen' .  Liner notes are an interview with "Alice Demain" on Paddy McAloon's early days in Whitley Bay and some discussion of the songs on the album.   However "A Demain" also means "see you later" in French, and this is probably a pseudonym, as was "Emma Welles" for the Swoon sleevenotes, which were written by Paddy McAloon himself. The part of Emma was also taken by Paula Goldberg of East Orange for an interview promoting the original release of "Steve McQueen" issued on cassette as "The Great Escape".    |

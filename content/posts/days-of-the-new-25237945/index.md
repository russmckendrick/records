Days of the New was an American rock band from Charlestown, Indiana, formed in 1995. The band later relocated to Louisville, Kentucky. The band consists of vocalist/guitarist Travis Meeks and a variety of supporting musicians. They are best known for the hit singles "Touch, Peel and Stand", "The Down Town", "Shelf in the Room", "Enemy", as well as radio hits "Weapon and the Wound", "Hang On To This" and "Die Born".
The band was formed by Meeks as an acoustic solo project during his teenage years. The first album, self-titled but informally known Yellow or Orange, featured Meeks, along with Jesse Vest, Todd Whitener and Mat Taul. Vest, Whitener and Taul went on to form Tantric. The group briefly included future pop star Nicole Scherzinger on the second album, also self-titled and informally known as Green. Other band members would include drummer Ray Rizzo, bassist Mike Starr (Alice in Chains) and bassist Charlie Colin (Train).

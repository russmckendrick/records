On his proper follow-up to <i>Graceland</i>, Simon introduces addictive Latin rhythms to sprightly West African guitars. Opening with the joyous massed drumming of “The Obvious Child,” from there he wields his soothing, conversational vocals to ponder modern life’s complexities, finding hope on the gospel-tinged “The Cool, Cool River.”

"The moment is here. Getting this together has been a monumental effort. It was never going to be done in half measures and by golly it hasn't been. This is EIGHT SIDES of premium FX Splatter Vinyl in a beautiful Hardcase gold foiled book. There's no doubt that it is expensive - but we guarantee that you will be blown away by this. One pressing only - you will never sell it and handle it only with white gloves (not included) Remastered for vinyl by Greg Norman. We can only afford 500 - so it will be strictly first come first served." |

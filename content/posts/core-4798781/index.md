After shifting vocal duties over the years, rock legends Stone Temple Pilots have settled on a fresh direction after landing Jeff Gutt (of <i>The X Factor USA</i> fame) as their new leading man. Their powerful, self-titled seventh studio album—their first major release since 2013’s <i>High Rise</i>—delivers more of the turbulent, driving rock the band are known for, most notably on tracks “Roll Me Under” and “Meadow”. It’s not all in-your-face riffs, though—STP strip things back beautifully too, making way for the brilliant ballads “The Art of Letting Go” and “Thought She’d Be Mine”.

Dividing their woozy mid-‘80s output from their later work’s clean-lined contours, 1988’s <i>Blue Bell Knoll</i> is a singular gem in Cocteau Twins’ sparkling catalog. The title track is among their most beautiful songs: Elizabeth Fraser’s lithe voice soars above crisp harpsichord, and the heartstring-tugging climax is all too short. The swirling churn of “Athol-brose” and “Suckling the Mender” tug toward shoegaze, and the album builds to a stunning finale with “Ella Megalast Burls Forever,” in which every element seems to shine brighter than everything else.

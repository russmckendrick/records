This handy, packed-to-the-brim career overview of Daryl Hall & John Oates contains not only the group’s six chart-toppers, but also plenty of other classic soul-pop singles and deep cuts from their ‘70s/’80s heyday. “Rich Girl” couches its biting critique in deftly deployed string arrangements, while the understated R&B croon of “Sara Smile” remains irresistible and sublime. Even lesser-known tracks like the sensuous, stinging “Your Imagination” illustrate how prolific and inspired this duo truly was.

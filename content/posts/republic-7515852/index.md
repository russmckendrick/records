Gillian Gilbert's melancholy background vocals on "World" are a sure sign of a band that's all grown up—older, wearier, wiser, but undaunted in their pursuit of transcendence. Recorded after Factory's demise, <i>Republic</i> is a darker album than <i>Technique</i>, with somber tones creeping into New Order’s lush mix of guitars and synths. They're still raving on "Spooky" and the driving "Chemical", though the acid house has taken on a nervous twitch, and "Liar" is tinged by desperation. But reflection becomes a chance to soar on the triumphant "Regret".

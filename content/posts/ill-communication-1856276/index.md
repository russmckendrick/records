For the first time in their album-making career, the Beastie Boys didn't reinvent themselves on <i>Ill Communication</i>. Instead, they moved laterally, amplifying the breakthroughs of <i>Check Your Head</i> in a manner that was even more satisfying than the earlier album. From slammin' mic fests ("Sure Shot," "Root Down") to hardcore punk rants ("Tough Guy," "Heart Attack Man"), Buddhist meditations ("Bodhisattva Vow") and sturdy organ-funk instrumentals ("Ricky's Theme"), this is a dizzying ride through everything that moves Ad-Rock, MCA, and Mike D. Without setting themselves up as teachers, they school many a funk-rocker in groove, humor, and style. Listen to the crunch of "Sabotage," which begat a hilarious video, or the roots salute "B-Boys Makin' With the Freak Freak." A true long-form masterpiece.

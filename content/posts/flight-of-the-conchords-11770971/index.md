For all the capering looseness on this debut from Kiwi comedy duo Flight of the Conchords—the futuristic ad-libs on “Robots”, say—it’s the loving craft and precision of these musical parodies that makes them soar. Whether they’re attempting a yé-yé song with limited French (“Foux Du Fafa”) or imagining a highly-specific Prince jam (“The Most Beautiful Girl (In the Room)”), Bret McKenzie and Jemaine Clement’s knowledge of, and affection for, their subjects shines through. One downside: you may never be able to listen to beloved records again without giggling.

Duran Duran’s second album elegantly and audaciously tests the boundaries of synth-pop, fleshing out New Wave guitars and disco grooves with shimmering keyboards and some of the '80s' catchiest hooks. "Rio" pits Simon Le Bon's suave voice against a sleek, driving pulse, while "The Chauffeur" sets him adrift among ethereal pads and pan pipes. John Taylor's muscular basslines propel "Last Chance on the Stairway" and "My Own Way"; "Hungry Like the Wolf" plays hard rock riffs off delectable vocal harmonies. The melancholy "Save a Prayer" sounds tailor-made for slow dances in the distant future.

Plenty of rock bands kicked ass in the '70s, but how many of 'em did it with street-tough poetry as part of the equation? Thin Lizzy's imagistic hard rock was propelled by bassist Phil Lynott's tough-sounding voice as well as a snaking, twin-lead guitar sound that would prove hugely influential. The group really hit their peak on this 1976 album. <i>Jailbreak</i> contains the band's only US hit, "The Boys Are Back In Town," but all the songs on it swagger and bounce without the cheesy self-mythologizing most of their peers fell prey to. This is nothing less than a literate hard-rock record, as essential to your musical understanding of the '70s as anything by T. Rex, Skynyrd, AC/DC, or even Springsteen.

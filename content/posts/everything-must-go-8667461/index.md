Shimmering, box-fresh anthems that sparked the second age of Welsh rock’s favourite outcasts. Forged in the aftermath of founding member Richey Edwards’ disappearance, <i>Everything Must Go</i> could have easily been a deeper dive into the sparse hopelessness of preceding record <i>The Holy Bible</i>. Instead, it feels like a glorious rebirth, replete with grand sweeps of orchestration (the lush, defiant wallop of “Design For Life”) and growling, stadium-ready guitars (“Australia”) that channel a kind of lyrically oblique Britpop that became the Manics’ most popular sermon.

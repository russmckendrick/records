Daryl Hall and John Oates are in peak form on this electric 1985 headlining set at the Apollo Theater, showing off their effortlessly tight-knit yet limber take on soul pop. With former Temptations Eddie Kendricks and David Ruffin in tow, the duo flash their bona fides on a rollicking introductory medley of Motown hits, before bringing it down to a simmer on a slow-burning take of “When Something Is Wrong With My Baby."

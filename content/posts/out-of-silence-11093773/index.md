Neil Finn took an unorthodox route to <i>Out of Silence</i>. Over four consecutive Fridays in August 2017, he gathered friends, family, artists, even a small orchestra and choir, in Roundhead Studios in Auckland and live-streamed the sessions. The final meeting on August 25 culminated in the complete recording of this album. It’s a return to organic chemistry, capturing the immediate, spontaneous, and whimsical moments that often get deleted in the era of Pro Tools.

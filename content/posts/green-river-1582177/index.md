CCR were at the height of their powers in 1969, <i>Green River</i> being the second of three LPs the band would release that year. Having found their sound on <i>Bayou Country</i>, Fogerty and crew fully step into their own with this release, which features the timeless singles "Bad Moon Rising", "Lodi" and of course the title track. <i>Willy and the Poor Boys</i> would soon follow, keeping up the band's ferocious pace, but if you had to pick just one CCR album, this should be it.

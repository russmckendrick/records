Far from stalling Suede, the departure of guitarist Bernard Butler seems to loosen them up. With snake hips, <i>Coming Up</i> wriggles free of <i>Dog Man Star</i>’s claustrophobia and Brett Anderson's melodramas ring with more defiance than despair. New boy Richard Oakes is a faithful substitute for Butler’s spidery effervescence on cocksure stomps “Trash” and “Beautiful Ones”, and “Saturday Night” confirms that they can still shape melancholy and nihilism into a gorgeous ballad.

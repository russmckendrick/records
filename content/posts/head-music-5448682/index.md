Suede recruited Paul Oakenfold collaborator Steve Osborne to produce their fourth album but the sound of Brett Anderson skanking on “Savoir Faire” notwithstanding, <i>Head Music</i> is not the left turn towards the dancefloor that would suggest. Instead, Osborne gives a reliably melodic, melodramatic collection satisfying crispness and an electronic sheen. From the shouty glam-boogie of “Elephant Man”, to “Electricity”’s crackling riffs and “She’s In Fashion”’s infectious, drunken synths, this is Suede’s most atmospheric and expansive record yet.

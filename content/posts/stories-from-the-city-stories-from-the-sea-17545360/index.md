| Apple Music Summary | Polly Harvey says she aimed for “absolute beauty” on her most upbeat, direct record yet. She’s certainly been reinvigorated by a love affair but that doesn’t mean her edges and explosiveness have been dulled. A simple drums-bass-guitar set-up carves the melodic lushness and “This is Love” declares its carnal desires with a dopamine rush of blues-punk, while “Big Exit” wraps the insecurities of love in a buzz of dual guitars and counter-melodies. Don’t expect a happy ending either: Thom Yorke duet “This Mess We’re In” is gorgeous but heavy-legged with impending trouble. |

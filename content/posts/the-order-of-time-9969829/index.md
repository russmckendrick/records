That many of the magnetic Americana heartmelters on <i>The Order of Time</i> were written over a long period makes sense. Ethereal, sonically nimble, and evocatively Southern, Valerie June's second record hums with an unhurried self-possession, tapping into traditions as far-ranging as rowdy dive-bar rock (“Shakedown,” which features Norah Jones on backing vocals) and slow-burn blues (“Slip Slide on By”). But “Astral Plane” is the kicker: a starlit, Velcro-catchy miracle that lets June’s transcendent delivery soar.

“The world moves on a woman’s hips”, David Byrne yelps on “The Great Curve”, summing up where his band is coming from on their genre-bending fourth album. You can hear them overhaul their nervy post-punk sound under the influence of African polyrhythms—and fearless producer Brian Eno—on “Once In a Lifetime” and “Crosseyed and Painless”, adopting trance-like beats and babbling loops of guitar/keyboards while Byrne chants free-associative lyrics that somehow make perfect sense.

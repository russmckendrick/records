The careful selection of covers on <i>Windy City</i> speaks volumes about Alison Krauss’ inspirations as an artist. Here, she offers a warmly nostalgic musical tour of mid-century Nashville. These are deep cuts—among the Bill Monroe b-sides and obscure bluegrass covers are only a few hits by Glen Campbell and Brenda Lee. But Krauss makes every song sound effortlessly her own, from the string-accompanied heartbreak “Losing You” to the gently swinging twang of “Dream of Me."

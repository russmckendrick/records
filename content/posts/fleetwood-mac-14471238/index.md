"Gypsy" is a song by British-American rock band Fleetwood Mac. The song was written by Stevie Nicks around 1979; the earliest demo recordings were made in early 1980 with Tom Moncrieff for possible inclusion on her debut solo album Bella Donna. However, when Nicks' close friend Robin Anderson died of leukemia, the song took on a new significance and Nicks held it over for Fleetwood Mac. "Gypsy" was the second single release and second biggest hit from the Mirage album, following "Hold Me", reaching a peak of No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks.
In 2017, Nicks recorded an acoustic version to serve as the theme song for the Netflix drama series Gypsy.

| Apple Music Summary | A band at the forefront of the smooth U.S. West Coast sound, Fleetwood Mac contained three gifted songwriters and remarkable vocalists who all wrote enduring anthems. This sprawling compilation cherry-picks the best of their remarkable ’70s and ’80s output, highlighting Christine McVie’s lovelorn lyrics and sweet melodies (“You Make Loving Fun,” “Don’t Stop”), Stevie Nicks’ mystical bent and ethereal vocals (“Rhiannon,” “Sara”), and Lindsey Buckingham’s winning way with pop hooks and experimental production techniques (“Go Your Own Way,” “Tusk”). |

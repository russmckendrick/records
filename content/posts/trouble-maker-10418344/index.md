Rancid’s ninth studio album arrives 24 years after their debut, but time hasn’t diminished their energy; this rollicking set finds the Berkeley punks as raw, committed, and passionate as they’ve ever been. The years have given them plenty of memories, and nostalgia rises off <i>Trouble Maker</i> like steam from a mosh pit, whether they’re saluting punk’s departed icons (“Say Goodbye to Our Heroes”), remembering good times with good company (“Buddy”), or venerating Berkeley’s activist history (“Telegraph Avenue”).

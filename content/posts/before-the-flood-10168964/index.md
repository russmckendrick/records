An urgent documentary inspires a soundtrack dream team. <i>Before the Flood</i> finds duo Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (<i>The Social Network</i>) joining forces with fellow Oscar winner Gustavo Santaolalla (<i>Brokeback Mountain, Babel</i>) and Scottish post-rock outfit Mogwai (<i>Zidane: A 21st Century Portrait</i>) for a collection of soundscapes that—alternately unsettling and breathtakingly beautiful—evoke the scale and horror of global climate change.

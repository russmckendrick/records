<i>Harvest Moon</i> nods without subtlety to Neil’s star-making 1972 album, <i>Harvest</i>, in both its name and laidback, countrified sound. However, this is the sound of an old(er) man taking a look at his life and fighting to keep his heart of gold from fading to rust. With the softly swaying romantic title track, Neil delivers a wedding slow-dance for the ages, but on “From Hank to Hendrix” and “You and Me,” he addresses the struggles that beset every long-term union.

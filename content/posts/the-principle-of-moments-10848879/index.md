For his second solo album following the dissolution of Led Zeppelin in 1980, Robert Plant teamed up with Phil Collins and other musicians to reinvent himself with a thrilling mix of new-age synths and prog rock. The mood is heady on “Big Log,” Plant cooing and moaning over twilit guitar twang. “Thru’ With the Two Step” sounds like a blues jam from Mars with its Brian Eno-esque electronic intro, while the off-kilter rock rhythm of “In the Mood” harks back to Plant’s Zeppelin days.

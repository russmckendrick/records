For anyone who’s ever felt downtrodden, AC/DC provided <i>Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap</i>. This 1976 album is a defiant one that kicks off with the ultimate teenage revenge fantasy—set to a dirty riff. From there on, it’s a wild night out with the boys from Down Under. Amidst all the clutter of boisterous FM radio in the late ’70s, AC/DC struck on something that was ferocious and pure, even in its puerility. The band could go from leering, locker room jokers to maniacal rock ’n’ rollers within the breadth of a song. This mixture, so evident on tracks like “Problem Child” to the ’50s rave-up of “There’s Gonna Be Some Rockin’” made AC/DC seem like a band you were never sure you wanted to party with or fear.

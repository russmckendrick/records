<i>Daybreaker</i> finds Orton at a crossroads, marrying her debut's folktronica to the Americana of <i>Central Reservation</i>. There's also a newfound cinematic streak‚Äîthe stately orchestrations of ‚ÄúParis Train‚Äù‚Äîand her diverse array of collaborators speaks to Orton's amplified stature. The Smiths' Johnny Marr co-wrote the languid ‚ÄúConcrete Sky‚Äù, while her earliest collaborators, the Chemical Brothers, underwrite the title-track's paranoid ambience. Emmylou Harris pops up on Nashville waltz ‚ÄúGod Song‚Äù, while Ryan Adams is a frequent presence: He lends backing vocals, and wrote the tender and lovely ‚ÄúThis One's Gonna Bruise‚Äù for Orton to sing.

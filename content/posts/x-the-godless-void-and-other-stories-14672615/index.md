Before the writing and recording of their tenth album, …And You Will Know Us By the Trail of Dead co-founder/multi-instrumentalist Conrad Keely experienced some life changes. After a five-year stay in Cambodia, Keely moved back to Austin in 2018 and reconvened with co-founder Jason Reece—a decision that allowed both of them to rekindle their musical partnership and celebrate their enduring career (best demonstrated when they embarked on a 20th-anniversary tour in support of their breakthrough 1999 release <i>Madonna</i>).<br />
Musically, Keely and his bandmates approach their return with a skilful balance of melody and raw urgency—and a witches’ brew of symphonic bombast. On the Pink Floyd-like “Who Haunts the Haunter”, Keely connects ideas of existentialism with references to ancient Greek mythology—always tackling such grand concepts in a whimsical and approachable manner. He writes about feeling displaced and breaking creative barriers on “All Who Wander” and “Something Like This”, adding sharp-edged riffs and layers of melodic picking over lavish piano strokes. “Children of the Sky” unburdens his sorrow with a cathartic release, conveying the hurt that comes from leaving someone or something meaningful over tumbling drums and an extended musical bridge.

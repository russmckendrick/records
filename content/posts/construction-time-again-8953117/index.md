Depeche Mode continued their fascinating evolution on album three. Alan Wilder joined the line-up, bringing an interest in sampling that manifests itself on all the industrial clatter of “Pipeline.” Martin Gore’s writing developed a political bent and singer Dave Gahan found more gravitas. The confection is realized best on “Everything Counts”, where grinding synths and an unflagging beat give way to a chorus that cloaks its attack on corporate greed inside sugary harmonies.

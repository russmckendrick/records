<i>The Color Before the Sun</i> is the first Coheed album to exist outside the dark universe of <i>The Amory Wars</i>—the elaborate sci-fi saga that entwines the band’s first seven albums with comics written by frontman Claudio Sanchez. Even without the narrative concept, <i>The Color Before the Sun</i> is one of the most focused albums of the band’s epic career. Launching to life with the catchy “Island”, Sanchez brings a fresh lyrical perspective to radio-ready rock (“Here to Mars", “You Got Spirit, Kid”), metal theatrics (“Eraser”) and cinematic prog-punk (“Peace To the Mountain”).

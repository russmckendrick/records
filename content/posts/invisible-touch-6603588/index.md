By the mid-'80s, it was hard to distinguish a Genesis record from a Phil Collins solo cut. <i>Invisible Touch</i> was released just a year after Collins' blockbuster <i>No Jacket Required</i>, and it plays like a sequel to that pop-rock classic. From the political "Land of Confusion" to the romantic ballad "In Too Deep" to the chart-topping pop of the title track, the album is packed with big hooks and glistening productionâ€”making for the most accessible and commercial distillation of Genesis' art-rock sound.

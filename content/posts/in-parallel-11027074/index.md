Hypnotic, compelling, and at times unsettling: welcome to the vivid debut solo album of Dhani Harrison. <i>IN///PARALLEL</i> is an electrifying meeting between modern industrial thumps and the Eastern-influenced sitar psychedelia made so famous by his father. The percussion and melodramatic strings on seductive opening track “Never Know” is a a stark contrast to the jarring distortion of “#WarOnFalse”. Elsewhere, “Downtown Tigers” and “Summertime Police” are woozy and eccentric. On <i>IN///PARALLEL</i>, Harrison's unique sound is on full display—but there's still room left to pay homage to George.

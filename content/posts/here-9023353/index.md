<i>Here</i> finds the Scottish indie veterans doing what they do best. Their 10th full-length is a beautifully crafted set of chiming guitars and poignant reflection that borders on the bittersweet—from the psychedelic sadness of “I Was Beautiful When I Was Alive” to the autumnal strums of “The Darkest Part of the Night”, a song whose end we always dread.

On their seventh album, Depeche Mode struck upon a balance of lust, gloom, and melody that turned them into global superstars. Inspired by Priscilla Presley’s account of her life with Elvis, lead single “Personal Jesus” incorporates a rockabilly twang, the blues, and a preacher man’s fervor into their synth-pop, while “Enjoy the Silence,” originally written as a ballad, becomes one of their finest moments by mounting its mournful bass and pleading chorus onto house beats.

Mark Lanegan’s poet-of-the-underworld persona has proved remarkably flexible over the past 20 years. His fourth album with Mark Lanegan Band falls in line with 2014’s <i>Phantom Radio</i>, mixing the grit of blues and murder ballads with gothy electronic atmospheres. As always, the center of these songs is Lanegan’s voice, a husky instrument as threatening as it is seductive, be it on the brooding ‘60s shuffle of “Emperor” or the soaring “Nocturne,” which plays devil to U2’s angels.

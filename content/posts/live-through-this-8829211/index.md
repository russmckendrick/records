<i>Live Through This</i> is one of the best rock albums of the ’90s, full stop. Released at the height of the grunge boom, it mixes punk ferocity with catchy jangle-pop, and contains some of the most potent feminist lyrics to ever find their way onto the radio. "Miss World" smuggles its confrontational lines within easy-to-digest hooks, while the monster choruses and quiet-loud-explosive dynamics of "Violet" and "Doll Parts" established Courtney Love as a songwriting force to be reckoned with, drama be damned.

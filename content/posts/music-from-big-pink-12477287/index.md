Though it grew out of jam sessions in the basement of the band’s communal house in upstate New York, <i>Music From Big Pink</i> lures us to otherworldly environments. “I Shall Be Released” and “In a Station” emerge from floating, celestial sounds, while “Lonesome Suzie” is a Curtis Mayfield ballad soaked in tranquilized blues. The Band’s dreamy, hymn-like undertones come to light in “The Weight,” in which the triangulated harmonies of Richard Manuel, Rick Danko, and Levon Helm forge a new form of rustic gospel goodness.

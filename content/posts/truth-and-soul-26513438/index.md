With <i>Truth and Soul</i>, Fishbone certified their status as some of the most important, freethinking artists of the alt-rock era, the band your favorite band talked about. With their album-opening cover of Curtis Mayfield's soulful lament "Freddie's Dead," they define and transcend black music's past; with "Bonin' In the Boneyard," they lay the impossibly funky foundation for its future. "Ghetto Soundwave" and "Change" close this uproarious masterpiece with a pair of streetwise, socially conscious anthems that call for unity among the tribes.

Though it was officially a soundtrack for a rarely seen Barbet Schroeder film, <i>More</i> is a hugely important transitional album for Pink Floyd. Here the post-Syd Barrett lineup moves away from freeform psychedelia and masters song structure, while keeping their experimental edge. There's a lost classic in Roger Waters' soaring, spooky "Cymbaline", while "The Nile Song" is one of their heaviest rockers. But <i>More</i> mostly features the band's lyrical side: "Green Is the Colour" has to be the only Floyd song featuring a pennywhistle.

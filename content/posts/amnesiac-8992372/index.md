Having bloomed from the same recording sessions as <i>Kid A</i>, Radiohead’s fifth album offers an alternate angle on the restive experimentation of their post-‘90s phase. <i>Amnesiac</i> undoubtedly shares its predecessor’s electronic digressions (“Like Spinning Plates”) and jazz flourishes (most potently on the tumbling, percussive “Dollars & Cents”). But it also offers something even more challenging, replete with crumbling orchestral builds and—as on the plaintive “Morning Bell/Amnesiac”—invigorating bursts of Thom Yorke’s matchless falsetto.

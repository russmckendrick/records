| Notes | Like the original version this LP is released in an outer sleeve which has been made to look like a plain brown paper bag with stamped details. Each cover shows an alternate angle of a man in a bar. The scenario was photographed from 6 different viewpoints within the bar and then 6 different sleeve variations were created (with the letters A–F at the top of the spine denoting each variation). The large format insert features a 'magic' ink in different colours which appear on the design when gently wetting.   Runouts are etched. Runout side B, variant 1: string '214' is inverted Runout side A, variant 3: string '1=' is inverted Runout side B, variant 3: string '2T' is inverted  [Sticker on shrink wrap:] The classic album on 180g vinyl Includes In The Evening & Fool In The Rain Remastered & produced by Jimmy Page  [Insert:] Recorded and mixed at Polar Music Studios · Stockholm  [Paper bag rear:] Swan Song Inc. ℗ & © 1975 Atlantic Recording Corporation, a Warner Music Group Company.

| Notes | Note from back cover:   These songs were performed as a 5 song acoustic set at the band's final show at the Royal Albert Hall in October 2010. When the Octane Twisted live album was put together in 2012, the plan was to include several recordings from the RAH show, but the acoustic set was found to have too many technical issues. Instead the band elected to make studio recordings of the songs the way they had been performed on the night. Unfortunately work was not completed in time to be included on the album after all, and the recording was shelved until now.  Limited Edition of 3000 copies worldwide.  ©&℗ 2020 The copyright in this sound recording is owned by Porcupine Tree Ltd. |

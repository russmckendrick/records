Already infamous for his provocative lyrics, Prince continued to shock fans by bringing politics into the mix on 1981’s <i>Controversy</i>, unleashing some of pop’s funkiest protest jams. Powered by pulsating basslines and gleaming synth-pop riffs, tracks like “Controversy” and “Sexuality” are floor-filling anthems that cleverly question identity norms. Of course, no Prince album would be complete without a few lush ballads (“Do Me, Baby”) and raunchy rock jams (“Jack U Off”). <i>Controversy</i> is that perfect Prince combo of deep sensuality and social commentary.

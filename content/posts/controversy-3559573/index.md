Controversy is the fourth studio album by American recording artist Prince, released on October 14, 1981 by Warner Bros. Records. It was produced by Prince, written (with the exception of one track) by him, and he also performed most of the instruments on its recording. 
Controversy reached number three on the Billboard R&B Albums chart and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was voted the eighth best album of the year in the 1981 Pazz & Jop, an annual critics poll run by The Village Voice.This was the first of his albums to associate Prince with the color purple as well as the first to use sensational spelling in his song titles.

| Apple Music Summary | Already infamous for his provocative lyrics, Prince continued to shock fans by bringing politics into the mix on 1981’s <i>Controversy</i>, unleashing some of pop’s funkiest protest jams. Powered by pulsating basslines and gleaming synth-pop riffs, tracks like “Controversy” and “Sexuality” are floor-filling anthems that cleverly question identity norms. Of course, no Prince album would be complete without a few lush ballads (“Do Me, Baby”) and raunchy rock jams (“Jack U Off”). <i>Controversy</i> is that perfect Prince combo of deep sensuality and social commentary. |

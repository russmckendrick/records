With "Losing My Edge", James Murphy proved he had a better record collection than you. On <i>Sound of Silver</i>, he puts it to good use, crafting peerless tunes that draw from disco, dance-punk, krautrock, Detroit techno and more, all while still sounding quintessentially LCD—and incredibly moving. "New York, I Love You But You're Bringing Me Down" is a bittersweet dirge torn from the real-estate section, and the one-two punch of "Someone Great" and "All My Friends" is a masterstroke of middle-aged emo.

Small Change is the fourth studio album by singer and songwriter Tom Waits, released on September 21, 1976 on Asylum Records. It was recorded in July at Wally Heider's Studio 3 in Hollywood. It was successful commercially and outsold his previous albums. This resulted in Waits putting together a touring band - The Nocturnal Emissions, which consisted of Frank Vicari on tenor saxophone, FitzGerald Jenkins on bass guitar and Chip White on drums and vibraphone. The Nocturnal Emissions toured Europe and the United States extensively from October 1976 till May 1977.

| Notes | Like most Rhino reissues - Rhino pressed both an EU version and a US version [[r2933494]]. This is the EU pressing.  Front sticker has [url=http://www.discogs.com/label/Rhino+Vinyl]Rhino Vinyl[/url] [an imprint of [url=http://www.discogs.com/label/Rhino+Records+%282%29]Rhino Records[/url] ] logo on it together with cat number.  Sticker reads: "LPs cut from the original analog masters  Packages replicated to the finest detail  Manufactured with more care than ever  Music the way it was meant to be heard: One side at a time."   Judging from the matrix nos, it looks as though plating was done at RTI and EU version pressed by Optimal.  Contradicting what is printed on the hype sticker there is no lyrics inner sleeve on this reissue package.  Recorded complete and direct to 2-Track Stereo Tape at Wally Heider Recording, Hollywood, California on July 15, 19, 20, 21, 29, 1976. Disc mastering: Elektra Sound Recorders, Los Angeles.

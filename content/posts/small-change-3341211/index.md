| Notes | Like most Rhino reissues - Rhino pressed both an EU version and a US version [[r2933494]]. This is the EU pressing.  Front sticker has [url=http://www.discogs.com/label/Rhino+Vinyl]Rhino Vinyl[/url] [an imprint of [url=http://www.discogs.com/label/Rhino+Records+%282%29]Rhino Records[/url] ] logo on it together with cat number.  Sticker reads: "LPs cut from the original analog masters  Packages replicated to the finest detail  Manufactured with more care than ever  Music the way it was meant to be heard: One side at a time."   Judging from the matrix nos, it looks as though plating was done at RTI and EU version pressed by Optimal.  Contradicting what is printed on the hype sticker there is no lyrics inner sleeve on this reissue package.

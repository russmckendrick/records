Described by frontman Wayne Coyne as “Syd Barrett meets A$AP Rocky and they get trapped in a fairy tale from the future”, <i>Oczy Mlody</i>—Polish for “eyes of the young”—is a set of viscous, synth-driven nocturnes that extends the band’s recent run of moody experimentation. While “Galaxy I Sink” recalls the despair of 2013’s <i>The Terror</i>, the prismatic pop of “We a Family” sounds relatively unburdened, thanks in part to an appearance by friend and collaborator Miley Cyrus.

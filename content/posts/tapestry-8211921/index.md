Difficult as it may be, imagine for a minute that <i>Tapestry</i> wasn’t one of the most successful albums in music history; that it wasn’t a defining touchstone for both the boomer generation and the singer/songwriter movement. Freed from all the baggage, Carole King’s second album <i>still</i> overflows with emotionally honest, subtly soulful singing; masterfully written tunes that blend pop, folk, and R&B; and warm, organic but seamless production. But it’s the unguarded intimacy of <i>Tapestry</i> we love most, particularly on highlights like “It’s Too Late” and “You’ve Got a Friend."

Formed in Los Angeles, California in 1991 by vocalist Zack de la Rocha, guitarist Tom Morello, bassist Tim Commerford and drummer Brad Wilk, the band signed to Epic Records and released its self-titled debut album in 1992. The album reached number 45 on the United States Billboard 200 and was certified three times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales in excess of three million units. Rage Against the Machine singles "Killing in the Name", "Bullet in the Head" and "Bombtrack" charted in the United Kingdom and several other regions.The band returned in 1996 with its second studio album Evil Empire, which topped the Billboard 200 and was again certified three times platinum by the RIAA. Lead single "Bulls on Parade" was the band's first to chart in the US, reaching number 11 on the Alternative Songs chart, number 36 on the Mainstream Rock chart, and number 62 on the Radio Songs chart. The group's first video release, 1997's Rage Against the Machine, reached number 2 on the Billboard Music Video Sales chart and was certified double platinum by the RIAA. 1999's The Battle of Los Angeles topped the Billboard 200 and the Canadian Albums Chart.Rage Against the Machine released its final studio album, a collection of cover versions called Renegades, in 2000, reaching number 14 on the Billboard 200. The band broke up prior to the album's release, after de la Rocha announced his departure in October that year. The Battle of Mexico City video album was released in 2001, reaching number 4 on the Billboard Music Video Sales chart. Two years later, Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium reached number 7 on the Music Video Sales chart and the top 100 of the Billboard 200.In 2009, the band achieved its first UK Singles Chart number 1 when "Killing in the Name" became Christmas number one as the result of a Facebook campaign. To celebrate the achievement, the group reunited for a free concert at Finsbury Park in London on June 6, 2010, which was later released in the form of Live at Finsbury Park in 2015 and reached number 2 on the Billboard Music Video Sales chart.

| Apple Music Summary | It’d be interesting to know just how many suburban kids learned about Che Guevara, or that the FBI targeted Martin Luther King for his opposition to the Vietnam War, from <i>Rage Against the Machine</i>. It isn’t that its politics are obscure. If anything, part of the reason the album remains so powerful is the way it captures the generalized angst kids feel toward parents (“F**k you, I won’t do what you tell me!”) while also pointing at broader forms of control regarding education (“Take the Power Back”), law enforcement (“Killing in the Name”), and the carceral system (“Settle for Nothing”). Like Nirvana’s <i>Nevermind</i> or even the Red Hot Chili Peppers’ <i>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</i>, it reshaped ’90s rock and helped bring underground styles into the mainstream. It also plugs into a world beyond itself—the kind of music you can take to the gym but also build a syllabus around.<br /><br>	Like the revolutionaries, MCs, and hard rock that inspired it, <i>Rage Against the Machine</i> exists in all caps. Its most lasting lyrics—“Some of those that work forces/Are the same that burn crosses” (“Killing in the Name”), “Anger is a gift” (“Freedom”)—have the instant memorability of a protest chant; its riffs democratize their anger, having been stripped of the flashy, technical stuff and restored to the Black blues they come from. The immediacy isn’t just a metaphor for their message; it’s a functional way to spread the word and put power into the hands of the people: Why bother learning “Stairway to Heaven” when you can just learn “Bombtrack”?<br /><br>	It’s easy to see the ironies of a multi-platinum band advocating for radical left politics. But the music business has always found ways to monetize rebellion, from Elvis to John Lennon to the Sex Pistols. <i>Rage Against the Machine</i> transcends its contradictions by standing inside them and giving itself over anyway. Guitarist Tom Morello remembers a record executive hearing the band practice “Killing in the Name” as Zack de la Rocha screamed, “F**k you, I won’t do what you tell me!” 16 times. The exec sheepishly asked if this was the direction that they were going in. Yes, Morello said, it was. But just remember: He didn’t have to.<br>  |

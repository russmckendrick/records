Building on the hooky pop electronica that had internet oracles everywhere falling for their 2013 debut, Glaswegian trio Lauren Mayberry, Iain Cook and Martin Doherty return on a second record shimmering with icy, controlled confidence. “Leave a Trace” is a skittering R&B-influenced air-puncher while “Clearest Blue” builds to an almost impossibly euphoric riot of 80s synth stabs. It’s not all precision-engineered pyrotechnics though. Closing track “Afterglow” (complete with Mayberry’s haunting one-take vocal and a radiator clanking in the background) proves that Chvrches do stripped-down just as well as they do scrubbed-up.

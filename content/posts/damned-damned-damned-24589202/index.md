<i>The Beautiful & Damned</i> finds the Oakland rapper striving for balance in a rapidly changing world. G-Eazy examines cause and effect, angels and devils, late nights and blurry mornings with his low-key flow. Rearview glances are many, addressing addiction (“Sober”) and the ills of the world (“Love Is Gone”). Halsey assists on “Him & I,” which conjures up deep “’03 Bonnie & Clyde” vibes. Despite the dark outlook, he makes sure to celebrate the wins, jumping aboard a gold tank with Cardi B and A$AP Rocky on “No Limit,” a tribute to good times and the empire that Master P built. Most of all, G-Eazy puts his life under a microscope for all to see. You get a solid sense of his focus and growth as a pinpoint storyteller.

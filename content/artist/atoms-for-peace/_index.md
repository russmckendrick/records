summary: "Atoms for Peace were a rock supergroup comprising the Radiohead songwriter Thom Yorke , the Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea, Radiohead's producer Nigel Godrich , the drummer Joey Waronker of Beck and R.E.M., and the percussionist Mauro Refosco. Yorke formed Atoms for Peace in 2009 to perform songs from his debut solo album, The Eraser ; they toured in 2010. In 2013, they released an album, Amok, the product of combining Yorke's electronic music with the band's jamming. It received mainly positive reviews, with several critics likening it to Yorke's solo work. Amok was followed by a tour of Europe, the US and Japan."

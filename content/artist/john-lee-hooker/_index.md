title: "John Lee Hooker"
summary: "\"Boom Boom\" is a song written by American blues singer and guitarist John Lee Hooker and recorded in 1961. Although it became a blues standard, music critic Charles Shaar Murray calls it \"the greatest pop song he ever wrote\". \"Boom Boom\" was both an American R&B and pop chart success in 1962 and a UK top-twenty hit in 1992.
The song is one of Hooker's most identifiable and enduring songs and \"among the tunes that every band on the R&B circuit simply had to play\". It has been recorded by numerous blues and other artists, including a 1965 North American hit by the Animals."

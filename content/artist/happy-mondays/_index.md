title: "Happy Mondays"
summary: "Formed in 1982 in Salford, Greater Manchester, UK. Rock/Acid House fused group, formed out of the \"madchester\" scene of the late 1980s to mid-1990s. Legendary for their on/off stage antics, usually fueled by drink and/or drugs. Both lead singer and were renowned for their drink and drug fueled antics. Bez being the legendary member whose sole purpose was to dance in his own inimitable style on stage at their live gigs. One story of interest was when they went to record in Barbados at the studio at 's house, which ended-up being the album \"...Yes Please!\", after managers thought it would be good to get them away from the drink/drugs scene they were surrounded by in the UK, not realizing the massive drugs problem Barbados had at the time, meaning band members were found trying to sell much of the studio equipment to continue their binge! Disbanded in 1992, reformed in 1999, disbanded in 2000 and reformed in 2004. The original line-up got back together again in 2012."

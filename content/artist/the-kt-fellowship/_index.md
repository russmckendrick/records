title: "The KT Fellowship"
summary: "An unspecified group of performers/personnel that contributed to the live recording release \"\". All commercial copies of the album come with the text \"The KT Fellowship / Presents / Before The Dawn\" on the sleeve, but do not credit as the main artist â€“ although the album is universally perceived as a Bush album, including her own official website discography. Similarly, the 2014 concerts were not presented as concerts by her and only the banner 'The KT Fellowship' was used. Perhaps to help market the album, all commercial copies come with the sticker \"Kate Bush / Live 2014 \". \"KT\" originates from the mid-70s, when Kate did live gigs with her group. A \"KT\" symbol can also be found hidden in the artwork of all her album sleeves ."

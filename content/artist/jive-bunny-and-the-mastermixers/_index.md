title: "Jive Bunny And The Mastermixers"
summary: "Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers were a British novelty pop music act from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England. The face of the group was Jive Bunny, a cartoon rabbit who appeared in their music videos. Costumed actors also made promotional appearances as the character.
Doncaster DJ and producer Les Hemstock created the original \"Swing the Mood\" mix for the Music Factory owned Mastermix DJ service. It was then taken from there and developed as a single release by father and son team John and Andrew Pickles. The name Jive Bunny was devised by Andy Pickles. Ian Morgan a fellow DJ and co-producer also engineered and mixed some of the early releases along with Andy Pickles. Morgan was replaced in the early 1990s by DJ and producer Mark \"The Hitman\" Smith.
Jive Bunny's three number ones during 1989 were \"Swing the Mood\", \"That's What I Like\" and \"Let's Party\". All three songs used sampling and synthesisers to combine pop music from the early rock 'n' roll era together into a medley."

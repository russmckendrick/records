title: "Moby"
summary: "Born: September 11, 1965, Harlem, New York, NY, United States. Hall says he is the great-great-great nephew of Herman Melville, author of Moby-Dick. One of electronic music's most visible and talked-about figures, Moby's career comprises many years of work and many musical twists and turns. His career stretches all the way back to early rave and acid-house releases in the late 80s and early 90s as U.H.F. and Voodoo Child, through to his much loved/hated R&B/blues/pop/techno sample cut-ups of today. His most notable tracks from his early days include \"Next Is The E\", \"Everytime You Touch Me\" and \"Into The Blue\", and the classic \"Go\", as well as his early albums \"Ambient\" and \"Early Underground\". He was managed by Marci Webber. A brief outing into more rock-oriented territory came with 1996's \"Animal Rights\", followed by \"I Like To Score\" in 1997, highlighting his past movie score contributions . In 1999 and 2000, Moby found unprecedented pop success with the album \"Play\" and the slew of singles and radio tracks that came from it . Among other things, his appearance as a DJ in the foyer of the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards led many people to decry him as a sellout. Nonetheless, his follow-up album \"18\" tinkered very little with the \"Play\" sound and still received a mostly positive reception in 2002. Besides the many faces of his music, Moby also gathers controversy for his outspoken religious, dietary and animal rights views, as well as persistent rumors that his live shows are mostly pre-recorded. Every Moby release from the mid-90s onward has borne the text \"Animals are not ours to eat, wear or experiment on. Thanks to Christ.\" In addition to making music, Moby has founded two labels, and , and co-founded the restaurants \"Teany\" and \"Little Pine\" . He also has written the books \"Gristle: From Factory Farms to Food Safety\" , \"Teany Book\" , \"The Little Pine Cookbook\", the memoirs \"Porcelain\" and \"Then It Fell Apart\", as well as a photography book accompanying his album \"Destroyed\". Before becoming a DJ worked as a golf caddy."

title: "Thin Lizzy"
summary: "Thin Lizzy are an Irish hard rock band from Dublin. Formed in 1969, the group originally consisted of bassist and vocalist Phil Lynott, guitarist Eric Bell, drummer Brian Downey and keyboardist Eric Wrixon. The band broke up in September 1983, at which point the lineup included Lynott and Downey, guitarists Scott Gorham and John Sykes, and keyboardist Darren Wharton. In 1996, ten years after Lynott's death, the group reformed as a touring outfit with new bassist Marco Mendoza, and Sykes taking over lead vocal duties. The most recent lineup, which performed in 2019, consisted of Gorham, Wharton, vocalist Ricky Warwick , guitarist Damon Johnson , drummer Scott Travis , and bassist Troy Sanders, who has so far only featured that year."

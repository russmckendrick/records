title: "Eurythmics"
summary: "Eurythmics were a British pop duo consisting of Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart. They were both previously in the Tourists, a band which broke up in 1980. The duo released their first studio album, In the Garden, in 1981 to little success, but went on to achieve global acclaim when their second album Sweet Dreams , was released in 1983. The title track became a worldwide hit, reaching No.2 in the UK Singles Chart and No. 6 in Australia, before hitting No. 1 in Canada and the US Billboard Hot 100. The duo went on to release a string of hit singles and albums, including \"Love Is a Stranger\", \"There Must Be an Angel \" and \"Here Comes the Rain Again\", before they split up in 1990. Stewart became a sought-after record producer, while Lennox began a solo recording career in 1992 with her debut album Diva. After almost a decade apart, Eurythmics reunited to record their ninth album, Peace, released in late 1999. They reunited again in 2005 to release the single \"I've Got a Life\", as part of a new compilation album, Ultimate Collection.
Eurythmics have sold an estimated 75 million records worldwide. The duo have won an MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist in 1984, the Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal in 1987, the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music in 1999, and in 2005 were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame. In 2020 both Lennox and Stewart were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2022, the duo were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."

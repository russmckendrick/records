title: "Lianne La Havas"
summary: "Lianne La Havas is the self-titled third studio album by English singer Lianne La Havas. The album was released on 17 July 2020. Released after a five-year hiatus and written following La Havas' break-up, the album was inspired by the life cycle of nature and its ability to thrive, go away, and come back stronger. Recording of the album took place between October 2019 and December 2019, with sessions taking place in London, Bath and New York. The album's production was handled by La Havas along with long-term collaborator Matt Hales, co-producers Beni Giles, Sam Crowe and guest co-producer Mura Masa.
Lianne La Havas is a concept album with a song cycle that depicts the stages of a relationship, from early romance to demise. The album's musical style was inspired by Milton Nascimento, Joni Mitchell, Jaco Pastorius, Al Green, and Destiny's Child, resulting in a predominately neo soul album with elements of jazz and folk. Upon release, the album was met with rave reviews from critics, who praised the album's eclectic musical style and lyrical exploration."

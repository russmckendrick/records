title: "Rob Dougan"
summary: "Rob Dougan, who started as Rob D, is an Australian genre-blending music composer. Mixing the sound of orchestral film music, the beats of club Trip Hop, and bluesy vocals, he is only tangentially relatable to electronic music. He was known primarily for his 1995 breakthrough single 'Clubbed To Death ', popularized by 1999s The Matrix soundtrack. In 2002, 7 years after its initial release he released the track in the UK on his debut album Furious Angels. He moved to London, England c. 1990."

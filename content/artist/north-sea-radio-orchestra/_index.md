title: "North Sea Radio Orchestra"
summary: "The North Sea Radio Orchestra is an English contemporary music ensemble and cross-disciplinary chamber orchestra . Formed in 2002, the NSRO was set up mainly as a vehicle for the compositions of its musical director, Craig Fortnam, but has also performed works by William D. Drake and James Larcombe. The ensemble is notable for its post-modern fusion of Romantic music and later twentieth-century forms, and for its bridging of the worlds of contemporary classical music, British folk music, London art rock and poetry ."

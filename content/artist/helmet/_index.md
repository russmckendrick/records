title: "Helmet"
summary: "Helmet is an American alternative metal band from New York City formed in 1989 by vocalist and lead guitarist Page Hamilton. Helmet has had numerous lineup changes with Hamilton as the only constant member. Since 2010, the band has consisted of Hamilton, drummer Kyle Stevenson, guitarist Dan Beeman and bassist Dave Case.
Helmet has released eight studio albums and two compilation albums. After releasing their debut album, Strap It On , on Amphetamine Reptile, Helmet signed to Interscope Records and released three albums for the label, including the highly successful Meantime . Their next two albums ― Betty and Aftertaste ― were also successful, but did not match the critical or popular acclaim of Meantime. Helmet broke up in 1998, but reformed in 2004, and has since released four more albums ― Size Matters , Monochrome , Seeing Eye Dog and Dead to the World . The band is currently working on their ninth studio album."

summary: "Poison is an American glam metal band formed in 1983 in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. The most successful incarnation of the band consists of lead singer and rhythm guitarist Bret Michaels, drummer Rikki Rockett, bassist and pianist Bobby Dall, and lead guitarist and backing vocalist C.C. DeVille. The band achieved huge commercial success in the mid-1980s through the mid-1990s and has sold 18 million records in the United States and over 55 million albums worldwide.The band is perhaps best known for the Billboard Hot 100 number one hit single \"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\", and other top 40 hit singles in the 1980s and 1990s, including \"Talk Dirty to Me\", \"I Won't Forget You\", \"Nothin' but a Good Time\", \"Fallen Angel\", \"Your Mama Don't Dance\", \"Unskinny Bop\", \"Something to Believe In\", \"Ride the Wind\", and \"Life Goes On.\" The band's breakthrough debut album, the multi-platinum Look What the Cat Dragged In, was released in 1986, followed by Open Up and Say... Ahh!, which was certified 5× platinum in the US. Their third consecutive multi-platinum and best selling album was Flesh & Blood. In the 1990s following the release of the band's first live album, Swallow This Live, the band experienced some line up changes and the fall of glam metal with the grunge movement. But the band's fourth studio album, Native Tongue, still achieved Gold status and the band's first compilation album, Poison's Greatest Hits: 1986–1996, went double platinum.
The original line up reformed for a greatest hits reunion tour in 1999. The band began the 2000s with the release of Crack a Smile... and More!, followed by the Power to the People album. They released the album, Hollyweird, in 2002 and in 2006 the band celebrated their 20-year anniversary with The Best of Poison: 20 Years of Rock tour and album, which was certified Gold and marked Poison's return to the Billboard top 20 charts for the first time since 1993. Band members have released several solo albums and starred in reality TV shows. Since their debut in 1986, they have released seven studio albums, four live albums, five compilation albums, and have issued 28 singles to radio. In 2012 VH1 ranked them at No. 1 on their list of the \"Top 5 Hair Bands of the '80s\"."

title: "The Specials"
summary: "The Specials, also known as The Special AKA, are an English 2 tone and ska revival band formed in 1977 in Coventry. After some early changes, the first stable lineup of the group consisted of Terry Hall and Neville Staple on vocals, Jerry Dammers on keyboards, Lynval Golding and Roddy Radiation on guitars, Horace Panter on bass, John Bradbury on drums, and Dick Cuthell and Rico Rodriguez on horns. Their music combines the danceable rhythms of ska and rocksteady with the energy and attitude of punk. Lyrically, their work presented overt political and social commentary.
The band wore mod-style \"1960s period rude boy outfits \". In 1980, the song \"Too Much Too Young\", the lead track on their The Special AKA Live! EP, reached No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart. In 1981, the recession-themed single \"Ghost Town\" also hit No. 1 in the UK. After seven consecutive UK top 10 singles between 1979 and 1981, main lead vocalists Hall and Staple, along with guitarist Golding, left to form Fun Boy Three. Continuing as \"The Special AKA\" , a substantially revised Specials line-up issued new material until 1984, including the top 10 UK hit single \"Free Nelson Mandela\". After this, founder Jerry Dammers dissolved the band and pursued political activism. The group re-formed in 1993, and have continued to perform and record with varying line-ups, none of them involving Dammers."

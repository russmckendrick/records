title: "Gulp"
summary: "Gulp is Guto Pryce and Lindsey Leven, with Gid Goundrey providing guitar and Gwion Llewelyn on drums. Fuzzed-up bass, dream-folk vocals, acoustic and electronic drums and synths…their cinematic and ethereal sound is a musical manifestation of the road trip; the landscape and events along the way, filmic scenes and melodies – from the sun-squinting, flickering saturation and lens flare of the Californian desert to the gloamin of rural Scottish and Welsh homescapes."

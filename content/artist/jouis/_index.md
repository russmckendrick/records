title: "Jouis"
summary: "Jouis are a 5 piece band based in Brighton, UK. Combining Jazz, Psychedelia and Progressive Rock, their sounds are designed to open your mind, and spirit you away to new lucid dimensions. Jouis is a French word roughly translated as 'high enjoyment' , a philosophy the band has upheld since its inception in 2008 at the Brighton Institute of Modern Music. Playing regular shows across the UK, they quickly began cultivating a dedicated fan base, releasing 2 EPs and a 7” single, and drawing the attention of BBC 6 Music. Fast forward to June 2013, and Jouis embarked on a mission to build their own analogue studio in an office block in Brighton – a space where they now live and work. With the help from producer Phill Brown , they recorded their debut album, Dojo, live to tape. The resulting 9 tracks make for bold, confident, listening. Opening track All That Is And Is One flutters through wandering whimsy, shimmering guitar work and an ever propulsive rhythmic flex. Elsewhere Lp’s spindly opening guitar line evolves the track into Tame Impala territory, before the album truly finds its groove in a psychotropic mix of jazz and beat grooves, gentle psychedelia, and perfect four part Magical Mystery Tour-esque harmonies. You get the feeling that every passage has been poured over by the band. Jouis named their album Dojo. It’s a place of learning and a state of mind. Their journey from building the studio, through recording to tape, to releasing, has been a learning curve. On Dojo, Jouis embrace that curve, turning it inside out and intertwining it with their own personalities and ethos. Jouis have appeared at: Glastonbury, Secret Garden Party, Lounge On The Farm and Camden Crawl. Members: Members: Louis Pavlo , Joe Potter , Joe Woodham , Jack Dunwoody , Adam Johnson"

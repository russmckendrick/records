title: "The Prodigy"
summary: "The Prodigy are an English electronic dance music band formed in Braintree, Essex, in 1990 by producer, keyboard player and songwriter Liam Howlett. The original line-up also featured dancer and singer Keith Flint and dancer and occasional live keyboard player Leeroy Thornhill, dancer Sharky, and MC and vocalist Maxim. They were pioneers of the breakbeat-influenced genre big beat, and achieved mainstream popularity in the 1990s. Howlett's rock-inspired drum rhythms infused with electronic rave music beats/breaks were combined with Maxim's vocals, Thornhill's shuffle dancing style, and Flint's later modern punk appearance. The Prodigy describe their style as electronic punk.The band emerged during the underground rave scene and achieved early success in 1991 with their debut singles \"Charly\" and \"Everybody in the Place\", which reached the UK top five. After their debut album Experience , the band moved from their rave roots and incorporated techno, breakbeat, and rock influences on their follow-up, the critically-acclaimed Music for the Jilted Generation . They reached their commercial and critical peak with their third studio album The Fat of the Land , which went to No. 1 in 16 countries including the UK and the US and spawned the UK number one singles \"Firestarter\" and \"Breathe\". The album's third single, \"Smack My Bitch Up\", was a UK top ten hit and generated considerable controversy over its suggestive lyrics and music video. In July of 2022, the band completed their first tour since the death of frontman Keith Flint in March of 2019.
The Prodigy are one of the most successful electronic groups of all time. They have sold an estimated 25 million records worldwide, including over 4.7 million albums in the UK, and have scored seven consecutive UK number one albums. They earned titles like \"the premiere dance act for the alternative masses\" and \"the Godfathers of Rave\". The Prodigy have won many awards during their career, including two Brit Awards for Best British Dance Act, three MTV Video Music Awards, two Kerrang! Awards, five MTV Europe Music Awards, and two Grammy Award nominations."

title: "Joe Cocker"
summary: "Joe Cocker! is the second studio album by English singer Joe Cocker, released in November 1969. Following the template of his first LP, the album features numerous covers of songs originally performed by Bob Dylan , the Beatles , Leonard Cohen , and future touring partner Leon Russell . Cocker also co-wrote one song, \"That's Your Business Now\", with Chris Stainton, who was a frequent songwriting partner.
Cocker is backed by the Grease Band, two of whom, Chris Stainton and Henry McCullough, appeared on his first album. The Grease Band backed the singer at the Woodstock Festival in August 1969. However, Cocker would part ways with the group following the release of this record, citing a reluctance to tour; when they needed to meet live commitments in America, Cocker decided to organise a new band with the help of keyboardist Leon Russell, heralding a new musical direction for the singer on his subsequent studio releases.
The album charted in the UK in May 1972 at number 29 when it was re-released as a double pack with Cocker's first LP With a Little Help from My Friends. On its release, the album also charted at number 11 on the Billboard 200 in America, propelled by Cocker's well-received appearance with the Grease Band at Woodstock earlier in the year."

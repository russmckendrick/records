summary: "Supertramp were a British rock band that experienced massive global success in 1979 with their sixth album Breakfast in America. Marked by the individual songwriting of founders Roger Hodgson and Rick Davies , the group were distinguished for blending progressive rock and pop styles as well as for a sound that relied heavily on Wurlitzer electric piano. The group's lineup changed numerous times throughout their career, with Davies being the only constant member throughout its history. Other longtime members included bassist Dougie Thomson, drummer Bob Siebenberg and saxophonist John Helliwell.
The band were initially a prog-rock group, but starting with their third album, Crime of the Century , they began moving towards a more pop-oriented sound. They reached their commercial peak with 1979's Breakfast in America, which yielded the international top 10 singles \"The Logical Song\", \"Breakfast in America\", \"Goodbye Stranger\", and \"Take the Long Way Home\". Their other top 40 hits included \"Dreamer\" , \"Give a Little Bit\" , and \"It's Raining Again\" . In 1983, Hodgson left the group to pursue a solo career. Davies took over as the band's sole leader until 1988, after which they disbanded and periodically reformed in various configurations.
As of 2007, Supertramp album sales exceeded 60 million. They attained significant popularity in North America, Europe, South Africa, and Australia. Their highest sales levels were in Canada, where they had two diamond-certified albums , and their only number 1 singles anywhere ."

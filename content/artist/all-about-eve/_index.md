title: "All About Eve"
summary: "All About Eve was an English rock band. The initial creative core consisted of Coventry-born Julianne Regan , Huddersfield-born Tim Bricheno and Andy Cousin , with other members changing over the years. Their highest-charting UK single was \"Martha's Harbour\" . The band was active from 1984 to 1993, then 1999 to 2004, achieving four UK Top-50 albums. The band had been recognised for their \"unique, folk-rock-influenced take\" on the gothic rock style, and Regan has been described as \"certainly one of the more talented singers\" of the scene in the late 1980s."

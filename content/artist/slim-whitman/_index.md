title: "Slim Whitman"
summary: "Ottis Dewey Whitman Jr. , known as Slim Whitman, was an American country music singer-songwriter and guitarist known for his yodeling abilities and his use of falsetto. He claimed he had sold in excess of 120 million records, although the recorded sales figures give 70 million, during a career that spanned over seven decades, and consisted of a prolific output of over 100 albums and around 500 recorded songs, that not only consisted of country music, but also of contemporary gospel, Broadway show tunes, love songs and standards. In the 1950s, Whitman toured with Elvis Presley as the opening act.In the 1990s and 2000s, a new generation was exposed to Whitman through his songs featured in the film Mars Attacks!. His \"Indian Love Call\" would kill the invading Martians by causing their heads to explode every time the record was played. This proves the key to defeating the otherwise seemingly invincible invaders. Whitman's rendition of \"I Remember You\" was heard in Rob Zombie's House of 1000 Corpses."

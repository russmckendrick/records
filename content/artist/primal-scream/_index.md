title: "Primal Scream"
summary: "Primal Scream are a Scottish rock band originally formed in 1982 in Glasgow by Bobby Gillespie and Jim Beattie. The band's current lineup consists of Gillespie, Andrew Innes , Simone Butler , and Darrin Mooney . Barrie Cadogan has toured and recorded with the band since 2006 as a replacement after the departure of guitarist Robert \"Throb\" Young.
Primal Scream had been performing live from 1982 to 1984, but their career did not take off until Gillespie left his position as drummer of The Jesus and Mary Chain. The band were a key part of the mid-1980s indie pop scene, but eventually moved away from their jangly sound, taking on more psychedelic and garage rock influences, before incorporating a dance music element to their sound with their 1991 album Screamadelica, which broke them into the mainstream. The band have continued to explore different styles on subsequent albums, experimenting with blues, trip hop and industrial rock. Their most recent album, Chaosmosis, was released on 18 March 2016."

title: "Ulver"
summary: "Genre-spanning group from Norway, active since 1993. On their demos and first album, \"Bergtatt\", they played black/folk metal, 1996's \"Kveldssanger\" is an entirely acoustic folk album and 1997's \"Nattens Madrigal\" is raw, aggressive black metal. Around 1998 they began producing experimental, electronic and avantgarde music. Since 2000 the core of the band consists of Kristoffer Rygg, Tore Ylwizaker and Jørn H. Sværen. The three however collaborate with various musicians on their albums depending on the needs of the musical project at hand. Ulver means \"Wolves\" in Norwegian."

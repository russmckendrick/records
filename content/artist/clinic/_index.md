summary: "Clinic are an English rock band, formed in 1993 in Crosby, Liverpool by frontman Ade Blackburn, guitarist Jonathan Hartley, bassist Brian Campbell and drummer Carl Turney. The band were originally named Pure Morning.
Following the release of Free Reign in 2012 the band went on a seven year break before returning with Wheeltappers and Shunters, the first album written solely by Blackburn and Hartley. The band's latest album Fantasy Island only features Blackburn and Hartley, with press shots confirming the departure of Campbell and Turney. The band's business Clinic Voot Ltd. was dissolved in August 2019.The band are signed to Domino, and are noted for wearing surgical masks and outfits in concert and press shots. Blackburn has stated that this is an homage to San Francisco bands Crime and The Residents, and that \"I like the way there was a visual side to what they did, but it wasn't something too serious. It was like a tacky pun on the band name. I liked something a bit more ridiculous like that.\""

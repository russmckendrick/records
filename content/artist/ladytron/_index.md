The band's name was taken from the song \"Ladytron\" by Roxy Music. Former Roxy Music member Brian Eno said in 2009, \"Ladytron are, for me, the best of English pop music. They're the kind of band that really only appears in England, with this funny mixture of eccentric art-school dicking around and dressing up, with a full awareness of what's happening everywhere musically, which is kind of knitted together and woven into something quite new.\" Ladytron described their sound as \"electronic pop\", while music journalists have also described their sound as synth-pop, electronic rock, post-punk, and new wave, among other genres. Some of the group's songs contain lyrics written by Aroyo in her native Bulgarian."

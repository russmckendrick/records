title: "Dodgy"
summary: "UK indie-pop band, formed in 1990 in Hounslow. After Nigel left to record solo and pursue other interests in 2002, the band carried on with a new singer and additional guitarist. Dodgy \"Mk. II\" were short-lived and the band split up soon after, with Andy and Matt pursuing other interests and joining other bands and \"supergroups\". In 2009 the original lineup got back together for a week-long run of gigs at the Barfly in Camden and toured their comeback album in the winter of 2011 and throughout 2012, including a tour of the highlands and islands of Scotland."

title: "Sublime"
summary: "Sublime was an American ska punk band from Long Beach, California, formed in 1988. The band's line-up, consistent throughout its duration, consisted of Bradley Nowell , Eric Wilson , and Bud Gaugh . Lou Dog, Nowell's dalmatian, was the mascot of the band. Nowell died of a heroin overdose in 1996, resulting in the band's breakup. In 1997, songs such as \"What I Got\", \"Santeria\", \"Wrong Way\", \"Doin' Time\", and \"April 29, 1992 \" were released to U.S. radio.Sublime released three studio albums, one live album, five compilation albums , three EPs, and one box set. Although their first two albums—40oz. to Freedom and Robbin' the Hood —were slightly popular in the United States, Sublime did not experience major commercial success until 1996 with their self-titled third album, released two months after Nowell's death, which peaked at No. 13 on the Billboard 200, and spawned the single \"What I Got\", which remains the band's only No. 1 hit single in their musical career. As of 2022, the band has sold over 20 million albums worldwide, including about ten million in the U.S. alone. Michael \"Miguel\" Happoldt and Marshall \"Ras MG\" Goodman contributed to several Sublime songs.
In 2009, the surviving members attempted to reform the band with Rome Ramirez, a young guitarist and avowed Sublime fan from California. However, not long after performing at Cypress Hill's Smokeout Festival, a Los Angeles judge banned the new lineup from using the Sublime name as they needed permission from Nowell's estate, which owns the rights to the Sublime name. This prompted the lineup of Wilson, Gaugh and Ramirez to change their name to Sublime with Rome, which has since released three albums, although Gaugh left the group shortly after the release of their 2011 debut Yours Truly."

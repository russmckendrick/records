title: "Weather Systems"
summary: "Weather Systems is the ninth album by the British rock band Anathema. It was released on 16 April 2012 in Europe via Kscope and 24 April 2012 in the US via The End Records. The band describes the album as \"not background music for parties. The music is written to deeply move the listener\". The album was recorded in Liverpool, North Wales and Oslo, each place significant to Anathema's past, present and future. The record was produced by band members Vincent Cavanagh and Daniel Cavanagh, as well as Christer-Andr√© Cederberg.
Recorded and released between the departure of Les Smith and the full-time joining of live member Daniel Cardoso, it is the first album of the band to not feature a full-time keyboardist since Judgement in 1999; instead, keyboard duties were shared between Vincent and Daniel Cavanagh, and drummer John Douglas. On future albums, Cardoso would replace Douglas as the band's primary keyboardist.
The album's official track list was announced on 2 February 2012."

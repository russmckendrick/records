title: "Airhead"
summary: "Airhead is a British indie-pop band that achieved some success in the early 1990s, at the tail end of the Madchester music movement. In 1996, Airhead made a brief return to the live scene, when they supported Kula Shaker, at the Tunbridge Wells Forum. In June 2007, the fan site Airhead Online began a petition to convince the major record label Warners, owner of Airhead's label Korova, to reissue Boing!! in expanded format with bonus tracks and liner notes from the band."

Their hit singles included \"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go\" and \"Last Christmas\". Establishing themselves as a global act, Wham! toured China in April 1985; the tour was the first visit to China by a Western popular music act, and it generated worldwide media coverage. Written primarily by George Michael, the biggest chart topper by Wham!, \"Careless Whisper\", reached number one in over 20 countries, including the UK and US.Before embarking on the production of his first solo album, Michael went on to release two number-one solo singles, \"A Different Corner\" and the Aretha Franklin duet \"I Knew You Were Waiting \".

His second solo album, Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1 , sold approximately eight million copies and was a UK number-one. It included the Billboard Hot 100 number-one \"Praying for Time\" and the worldwide hit \"Freedom! '90\". A 1991 live duet with Elton John, \"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\", was also a transatlantic number one. Michael went on to release two more multimillion-selling albums, Older and Patience .
Outside music, Michael was an active LGBT rights campaigner and HIV/AIDS charity fundraiser.

Michael came out as gay in 1998. The 2005 documentary A Different Story covered his career and personal life. Michael's 25 Live tour spanned three tours from 2006 to 2008.

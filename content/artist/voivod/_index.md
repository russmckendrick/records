title: "Voïvod"
summary: |
  Formed: 1982 in Jonquière, Quebec, Canada. Thrash metal band influenced by the NWOBHM, Hardcore and Progressive Rock. Voïvod are easily identifiable by their use of unusual time signatures, dissonant guitar chords and lyrical themes influenced by post-apocalyptic literature, cold war politics and science fiction. Founding members Jean-Yves Thériault alias Blacky (2) (bass) and Denis Bélanger alias Snake (6) (vocals) departed the band in the early 1990s (though Bélanger would return and leave the band several times until the mid 1990s), guitarist Denis D'Amour alias Piggy and drummer Michel Langevin alias Away forged ahead with new member Eric "E-Force" Forrest on bass and vocals. Forrest departed in 2001 and Voïvod went on hiatus for a year. The band reformed in 2002 with Denis "Snake" Bélanger returning on vocals and ex-Metallica member Jason "Jasonic" Newsted performing bass duties in the studio. Voïvod found itself on hiatus once more as guitarist Denis "Piggy" D'Amour was diagnosed with cancer of the colon, he passed away in 2005. In 2009 the band released its twelfth studio album [r=1922763, which features the last music written and recorded by D'Amour. Currently, Voïvod continues to perform live and still releases albums to critical acclaim. Their album [m1425025 reached number 8 of the Best Metal albums of 2018 in Rolling Stone.

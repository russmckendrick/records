title: "Robert Plant"
summary: "Robert Anthony Plant is an English singer and songwriter, best known as the lead singer and lyricist of the rock band Led Zeppelin for all of its existence from 1968 until 1980. Regarded by many as one of the greatest singers in rock music, he is known for his flamboyant persona and raw stage performances.
In 1995, Plant was inducted with the band into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Plant enjoyed great success with Led Zeppelin from the late 1960s to the end of the 1970s. He developed a compelling image as the charismatic rock-and-roll front man, comparable to contemporaries such as Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones, Roger Daltrey of the Who, Jim Morrison of the Doors, and Freddie Mercury of Queen. After Led Zeppelin dissolved in 1980, Plant continued to perform and record continuously on a variety of solo and group projects. His first well known post-Led Zeppelin project was The Honeydrippers, alongside former Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page, among others. In 1988, he released the solo album Now and Zen, which spawned the hit singles \"Tall Cool One\" and \"Ship of Fools\". In the 1990s, another reunion project named Page and Plant released two studio albums and a live album from an MTV Unplugged performance, as well as winning the Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance in 1998 for \"Most High\". In 2007, he began a collaboration with bluegrass artist Alison Krauss, releasing the album Raising Sand, which won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 2009 and produced the hit song \"Please Read the Letter\", which won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year the same year. In 2010, he revived the Band of Joy , and in 2012 formed a new band, the Sensational Space Shifters, followed by a reunion with Alison Krauss in 2019.
In 2008, Rolling Stone editors ranked him number 15 on their list of the 100 best singers of all time. In 2011, Rolling Stone readers ranked Plant the greatest of all lead singers. In 2006, Hit Parader magazine named Plant the \"Greatest Metal Vocalist of All Time\". In 2009, Plant was voted \"the greatest voice in rock\" in a poll conducted by UK classic rock radio station Planet Rock."

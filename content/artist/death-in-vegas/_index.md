title: "Death In Vegas"
summary: "Death in Vegas is an electronic rock band from the United Kingdom, a brainchild of Richard Fearless . Tim Holmes was not involved into recording process of \"Trans-Love Energies\", and he is not the part of the current Death in Vegas line up. Influenced by a wide range of musical genres including psychedelic rock, electronic, krautrock, dub and industrial, the band's sound is constantly changing, moving between live rock sounds and electronic. The band was formed in London in 1994 by Fearless and Steve Hellier and signed to Concrete Records under the name of \"Dead Elvis\". Objections from the estate forced them to change their name, and Dead Elvis became the title of their first album instead."

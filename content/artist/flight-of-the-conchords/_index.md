title: "Flight Of The Conchords"
summary: "Flight of the Conchords is a New Zealand musical comedy duo formed in Wellington in 1998. The band consists of multi-instrumentalists Bret McKenzie and Jemaine Clement. Beginning as a popular live comedy act in the early 2000s, the duo's comedy and music became the basis of the self-titled BBC radio series and, subsequently, the HBO American television series . Most recently, they released the HBO comedy special Live in London in 2018. The special was concurrently released by Sub Pop as their fifth album. The duo's live performances have gained them a worldwide cult following, and they continue to tour periodically. They were named Best Alternative Comedy Act at the 2005 US Comedy Arts Festival and Best Newcomer at the Melbourne Comedy Festival, and received a nomination for the Perrier Comedy Award at the 2003 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. They have been twice-nominated for a Grammy Award—winning Best Comedy Album in 2008—and have received seven nominations for Emmy Awards.
Previously, they referred to themselves as \"New Zealand's fourth most popular guitar-based digi-bongo acapella-rap-funk-comedy folk duo\"; as of 2014, however, they refer to themselves as \"the almost award-winning fourth-most-popular folk duo in New Zealand\"."

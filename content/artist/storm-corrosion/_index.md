title: "Storm Corrosion"
summary: "Storm Corrosion was a musical collaboration between Swedish musician Mikael Åkerfeldt of progressive metal band Opeth and English musician Steven Wilson of the progressive rock band Porcupine Tree. Åkerfeldt and Wilson began a longstanding musical partnership in 2001 when Wilson produced Opeth's fifth studio album Blackwater Park. The two began writing together for a new project in 2010, releasing their self-titled only studio album in 2012 through Roadrunner Records.
A critical success, Storm Corrosion was a musical shift for Åkerfeldt and Wilson. Not wanting the project to be a progressive metal supergroup, the two used it as an opportunity to explore their more esoteric tastes in music, including influences from Comus and Scott Walker. No touring to promote the album was undertaken, nor were any plans for future music established, with the two instead opting to return to their respective other musical projects. Drag Ropes however received it's live debut in 2015 where Åkerfeldt guested during a two-night stint of Wilson at the Royal Albert Hall. Wilson continued to perform the song live during the tour promoting the 4 1/2 record in winter 2016"

title: "Garbage"
summary: "Alternative / modern rock band from Madison, Wisconsin, USA. Shirley Manson - vocals, keyboards, guitar Duke Erikson - bass, guitar, keyboards Steve Marker - guitar, keyboards, loops Butch Vig - drums, loops, noise, fx In the early 1980s, rock producers Vig and Marker founded Smart Studios, a recording studio in Madison, Wisconsin. Vig and musician friend Erikson formed the group Fire Town in the late 1980s, an offshoot from their disbanded band Spooner. Marker was their roadie. Vig and Marker began making electronic/rock mixes for artists like Nine Inch Nails and House Of Pain. In 1993 they decided they wanted to form a band that employed the remix and genre-bending approach they experimented with earlier and began looking for a singer and fourth collaborator. Guitarist Steve Marker came across a video of Scottish band Angelfish on MTV's \"120 Minutes\". Struck by the lead singer's voice, he informed the guys and their manager contacted Manson, inviting her to audition in Madison, Wisconsin. After an unsuccessful audition, Manson asked to audition again, which led to skeletal versions of a few songs. The band officially formed in 1994, and released their self-titled debut in 1995. All four members are involved in songwriting and production."

title: "House Of Pain"
summary: "House of Pain was an American hip-hop trio that released three albums in the 1990s. The group consisted of DJ Lethal, Danny Boy, and Everlast. The group's name is a reference to the H. G. Wells novel The Island of Dr. Moreau, a reference carried further by the naming of their 2011 tour He Who Breaks the Law. The group is best known for its 1992 hit single \"Jump Around\", which reached number 3 in their native United States of America, number 6 in Ireland and number 8 in the United Kingdom. The group broke up in 1996 due to what Everlast described as a toxic environment fueled by Danny Boy's drug addiction. Lead rapper Everlast eventually went on to pursue a solo career as a blues rock artist and member of the supergroup La Coka Nostra which also featured DJ Lethal. House of Pain reunited briefly in 2010 for a world tour."

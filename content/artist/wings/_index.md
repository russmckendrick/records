title: "Wings"
summary: "This band was a successful endeavour for ex-Beatle . From its inception in late 1971 the line-up of \"Wings\" often changed over the years, but retained its core members: • on guitar and vocals • on keyboards and vocals • Paul McCartney on guitar and vocals. Other members of the band included drummer , ex- guitarist , blues guitarist , drummer , drummer , guitarist and drummer Steve Holly . Whilst \"Wings\" was primarily McCartney's band , it was truly a collaborative effort, with all members of the band sharing a hand in songwriting and vocals - with Laine even taking lead vocals from time to time."

title: "The Beautiful South"
summary: "The Beautiful South were an English pop rock group formed in 1988 by Paul Heaton and Dave Hemingway, two former members of the Hull group The Housemartins, both of whom performed lead and backing vocals. Other members throughout the band's existence were former Housemartins roadie Sean Welch , Dave Stead and Dave Rotheray . The band's original material was written by Heaton and Rotheray.
After the band's first album, Welcome to the Beautiful South , they were joined by a succession of female vocalists. All of the following artists performed lead and backing vocals alongside Heaton and Hemingway â€“ Briana Corrigan for albums two and three after appearing as a guest vocalist on one, followed by Jacqui Abbott for the fourth to seventh albums, and finally Alison Wheeler for the final three Beautiful South albums.
The group were known for their wry and socially observant lyrics. They broke up in January 2007, claiming the split was due to \"musical similarities\", having sold around 15 million records worldwide."

title: "Sex Pistols"
summary: "The most famous band of the late 70s British punk scene. Their rebellious image combined with a commercial sound created some of the most memorable moments of the 70s - both musical and otherwise. Line-up: Johnny Rotten , Steve Jones , Glen Matlock and Paul Cook . In February 1977, Matlock was replaced by Sid Vicious . The band effectively split up after their 1978 US tour, although Jones and Cook continued to record under the name for another year or so. The original line-up reformed in 1996 for a series of concert tours, and has played live shows off and on since then, and released live recordings. For copyrights to the band, see ."

title: "Stiff Little Fingers"
summary: "Northern Irish punk band formed around 1977, the original members being Jake Burns, Ali McMordie, Henry Cluney & Brian Faloon. This version of the band recorded their first LP \"Inflammable Material\" which included their signature songs about life in Belfast \"Alternative Ulster\", \"Suspect Device\" and \"Wasted Life\" as well as a musically bold reworking of Bob Marley's \"Johnny Was\". Moving to London in 1979, the band lost Brian Faloon who was replaced on drums by Jim Reilly. They recorded the LP \"Nobody's Heroes\" for Chrysalis, an LP which was more pop than \"Inflammable Material\" but continued exploring similar themes. A cover of The Specials' \"Doesn't Make It Alright\" was included, though less successfully than \"Johnny Was\". \"Nobody's Heroes\" was followed by the live LP \"Hanx\" as well as the pure power pop of the LPs \"Go For It\" and \"Now Then\" , which failed to satisfy their fans. In 1983 the band decided to call it a day. In 1987, Burns reformed the band with McMordie, Cluney and Taylor. When McMordie left in 1990, he was replaced on bass by Bruce Foxton, previously of , though McMordie rejoined in 2006. The current incarnation of SLF, which still tours, includes Burns, bassist Ali McMordie, guitarist Ian McCallum and drummer Steve Grantley. 2015 marked the first release of , a band featuring both Cluney and Reilly ex-SLF as well as two other musicians. Reilly has since left due to health reasons, although the band still appears to be active."

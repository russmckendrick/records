title: "Porno For Pyros"
summary: "Porno for Pyros was an American alternative rock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1992, following the first break-up of Jane's Addiction. The band currently consists of Jane's Addiction members, Perry Farrell and Stephen Perkins , alongside Peter DiStefano and Mike Watt . Founding bass guitarist Martyn LeNoble was a member of the band between 1992 and 1995, and was initially committed to the band's reunion between 2022 and 2023.
The band released two studio albums, Porno for Pyros and Good God's Urge , before going on hiatus in 1998. In 2009, the original line-up reunited for a one-off appearance at frontman Perry Farrell's 50th birthday party. In 2020, the Watt-era line-up of the band reunited for Lolla2020, a free YouTube broadcast event taking place amidst global COVID-19 lockdowns. Following the appearance, members of the group continued to work on new material together, and in 2022, Farrell and Perkins reunited Porno for Pyros for their first large-scale public performances in more than 24 years, leading to a full reunion of the band's original line-up at Welcome to Rockville festival.
The original four-piece recorded new material in 2023, with plans to release a four-track EP in 2024. After a full reunion tour was rescheduled to 2024, LeNoble amicably left the band in November 2023, with the band subsequently announcing that their forthcoming tour would be a farewell tour."

title: "The Chemical Brothers"
summary: "Tom & Ed met in history class at Manchester University in 1989. They started as DJs known as \"The 237 Turbo Nutters\" . They then opted for \"The Dust Brothers,” which they nicked from the L.A. producers of the Beastie Boys' 1989 Album \"Paul's Boutique,” as they thought they would never be famous. In 1995 they changed their name to \"The Chemical Brothers,” after the real Dust Brothers threatened to sue."

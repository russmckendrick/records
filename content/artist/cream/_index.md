title: "Cream"
summary: "Cream were a British rock band formed in London in 1966. The group consisted of bassist Jack Bruce, guitarist Eric Clapton, and drummer Ginger Baker. Bruce was the primary songwriter and vocalist, although Clapton and Baker contributed to songs. Formed by members of previously successful bands, they are widely regarded as the first supergroup. Cream were highly regarded for the instrumental proficiency of each of their members. During their brief three-year career, the band released four albums, Fresh Cream , Disraeli Gears , Wheels of Fire , and Goodbye . Beginning with Disraeli Gears, the band was joined in the studio by producer and multi-instrumentalist Felix Pappalardi, who became an important influence on the band's sound. Cream's music spanned many genres of rock music, including blues rock , psychedelic rock , and hard rock . Throughout their career, they sold more than 15 million records worldwide. The group's third album, Wheels of Fire , is the first platinum-selling double album.Tensions between Bruce and Baker led to their decision in May 1968 to break up, though the band were persuaded to make a final album, Goodbye, and to tour, culminating in two final farewell concerts at the Royal Albert Hall on 25 and 26 November 1968 which were filmed and shown in theatres, then in 1977 released as a home video, Farewell Concert.
In 1993, Cream were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. They were included in both Rolling Stone and VH1's lists of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\", at number 67 and 61 respectively. They were also ranked number 16 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\"."

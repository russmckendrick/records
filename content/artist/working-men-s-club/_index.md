title: "Working Men's Club"
summary: "Working Men's Club is a UK band hailing from Todmorden in West Yorkshire, England. The band were formed in mid-2018 by vocalist/guitarist Sydney Minsky-Sargeant, guitarist Giulia Bonometti, and drummer Jake Bogacki. After the release of their debut single Bad Blood, the band evolved towards a more electronic sound, with Bonometti and Bogacki leaving the project, replaced by bassist Liam Ogburn, and multi-instrumentalists Mairead O'Connor and Rob Graham. Graham left prior to the release of “Fear Fear,” the band’s second album, in 2022. His replacement, multi-instrumentalist Hannah Cobb, also plays in with Ogburn."

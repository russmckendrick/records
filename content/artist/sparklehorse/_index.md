title: "Sparklehorse"
summary: "Sparklehorse was an American indie rock band from Richmond, Virginia, led by singer and multi-instrumentalist . Sparklehorse was active from 1995 until Linkous' 2010 death by suicide. Prior to forming Sparklehorse, Linkous fronted local bands Johnson Family and Salt Chunk Mary. Only one song, \"Someday I Will Treat You Good,\" survived from these earlier bands to be played by Sparklehorse. Linkous stated that he ultimately chose Sparklehorse for a name because the two words sounded good together and it could loosely be used as a metaphor for a motorcycle."

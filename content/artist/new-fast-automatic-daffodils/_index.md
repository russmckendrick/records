title: "New Fast Automatic Daffodils"
summary: "New Fast Automatic Daffodils were an indie rock group from Manchester, England, active between 1988 and 1995. The group's early material was partly Madchester-inspired danceable guitar licks with deft and welcome touches of post-punk, funk, dub and Krautrock. The songwriting matured and expanded to encompass a broader emotional spectrum on the second album, \"Body Exit Mind\", and reached a creative zenith on the third album, \"Love It All\", the group's swan song. Members: Andy Spearpoint , Justin Crawford , Dolan Hewison , Perry Saunders , Icarus Wilson-Wright"

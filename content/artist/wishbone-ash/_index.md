title: "Wishbone Ash"
summary: "Wishbone Ash is a British rock band who achieved success in the early to mid-1970s. Their albums include Wishbone Ash , Pilgrimage , Argus , Wishbone Four , There's the Rub , and New England .
Wishbone Ash is noted for its extensive use of harmony twin lead guitars, which had been attracting electric blues bands since Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page had played together in the Yardbirds in 1966. Their contributions helped Andy Powell and Ted Turner to be voted \"Two of the Ten Most Important Guitarists in Rock History\" . Melody Maker described Powell and Turner as \"the most interesting two guitar team since the days when Beck and Page graced The Yardbirds\". Several notable bands have cited Wishbone Ash as an influence, including Iron Maiden, Van Halen, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Thin Lizzy, Metallica, Dream Theater, Overkill and Opeth.Formed in Torquay, Devon, in 1969, out of the ashes of the trio The Empty Vessels , which had been formed by Wishbone Ash's founding member and creative force Martin Turner in 1963 and complemented by Steve Upton in 1966. Wishbone Ash formed when Martin Turner and Steve Upton set up auditions for a guitarist and subsequently ended up with two guitarists because they couldn't decide between the two. So as a result, guitarists/vocalists Andy Powell and Ted Turner completed the original Wishbone Ash line-up. In 1974, Ted Turner left the band, and was replaced by Laurie Wisefield. The band continued on with strong critical and commercial success until 1980. There followed line-ups featuring former bass players from King Crimson , Uriah Heep , and Trapeze . Wisefield left in 1985. In 1987, however, the original line-up reunited for several albums – Nouveau Calls, Here to Hear and Strange Affair – until 1990, when Upton quit the band. After Martin Turner was replaced in 1991, the band recorded The Ash Live in Chicago, before Ted Turner left in 1993. This left Andy Powell as the sole remaining original founding member of Wishbone Ash to continue the band on into the future."

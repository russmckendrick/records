title: "Rodrigo Y Gabriela"
summary: "Rodrigo y Gabriela are a Mexican musical duo who specialize in playing fast, rhythmic acoustic guitars. The duo's members are Rodrigo Sanchez, lead guitar, and Gabriela Quintero, rhythm guitar. The duo met in Mexico City while playing in a thrash metal band called \"Tierra √Åcida\". Growing frustrated with the limited scope of the domestic music scene, they moved to Europe, where they met considerable acclaim. They took up residence in Dublin, Ireland, after hearing it was particularly welcoming to travelling musicians. Playing live gigs in various pubs and busking on Grafton Street and Temple Bar allowed them to practice their sound. They received their break when Damien Rice approached them to provide the support for the Irish music festival Oxegen. In 2005 they toured extensively in festivals around the United Kingdom and beyond."

summary: "Betty Davis was an American singer, songwriter, and model. She was known for her controversial sexually-oriented lyrics and performance style and was the second wife of trumpeter Miles Davis. Her AllMusic profile describes her as \"a wildly flamboyant funk diva with few equals ... combined the gritty emotional realism of Tina Turner, the futurist fashion sense of David Bowie, and the trendsetting flair of Miles Davis\"."

summary: "The Lemonheads are an American alternative rock band formed in Boston in 1986 by Evan Dando, Ben Deily, and Jesse Peretz. Dando has remained the band's only constant member. After their initial punk-influenced releases and tours as an independent/college rock band in the late 1980s, the Lemonheads' popularity with a mass audience grew in 1992 with the major label album It's a Shame about Ray, which was produced, engineered, and mixed by The Robb Brothers . This was followed by a cover of Simon and Garfunkel's \"Mrs. Robinson\", which eventually became one of the band's most successful singles. The Lemonheads were active until 1997 before going on hiatus, but reformed with a new lineup in 2005 and released The Lemonheads the following year. The band released its latest album, Varshons 2, in February 2019.Since its formation, recording and touring lineups of the band have included co-founders Deily and Peretz, John Strohm , Doug Trachten, Corey Loog Brennan, Byron Hoagland , Ben Daughtrey , Juliana Hatfield , Nic Dalton , Sneeze, The Plunderers), David Ryan , Patrick \"Murph\" Murphy , George Berz , Josh Lattanzi, Bill Gibson , Mark 'Budola' Newman, Kenny Lyon, Vess Ruhtenberg, Devon Ashley, Karl Alvarez and Bill Stevenson , P.

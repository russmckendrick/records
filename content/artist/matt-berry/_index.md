title: "Matt Berry"
summary: "Born in May 2, 1974, Bromham, Bedfordshire, England, Matt Berry is an actor and musician best known for his roles on the British sitcoms *The IT Crowd*, *The Mighty Boosh* and *Garth Marenghi's Darkplace*, and more recently internationally as Lazlo on the FX vampire comedy series *What We Do in the Shadows*, based on the New Zealand comedy film of the same name. Along with Rich Fulcher, he created and starred in the cult comedy series *Snuff Box*, which featured songs written and composed by Berry. He also wrote the 2004 parody rock opera *AD/BC* for BBC Three. As well as an actor, Matt also has a very colourful musical career and has released 10 albums, most of which through the label 'Acid Jazz'. The majority of his music is self composed, but every now and then, he has input from his band, 'The Maypoles', who also perform live on Matt's concerts. His most famous song is 'Take My Hand', as used in 'Snuff Box' during the Elton John sketch, and in 'Toast Of London', as the main theme. His theme to 'Snuff Box' was also featured very briefly in the blockbuster movie 'Dredd' and was covered by the American R&B artist 'Geno Washington'. Berry's music style varies from progressive rock, to experimental folk, all tied together with an electronic feel, with various reoccurring melodies in some songs. His inspiration comes from musicians such as 'Jean-Michel Jarre' and 'Vangelis', who he played as a cameo on 'Shooting Stars'."

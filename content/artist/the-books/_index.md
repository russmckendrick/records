title: "The Books"
summary: "Formed in New York City in 2000, when Zammuto and De Jong were neighbors in Inwood, a neighborhood in northern Manhattan. Their music combines elements of folk & acoustic and fuses it with electronic undertones. The two members do all of the group's production and mastering work on their home computers. Disbanded in January 2012."

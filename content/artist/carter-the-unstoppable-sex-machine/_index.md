title: "Carter The Unstoppable Sex Machine"
summary: "Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine were an English indie rock band formed in 1987 by singer Jim \"Jim Bob\" Morrison and guitarist Les \"Fruitbat\" Carter. They made their name with a distinctive style of power pop, fusing samples, sequenced basses and drum machines with rock 'n' roll guitars and off-beat wordplay-loaded lyrics. They reached the height of their fame in 1992. Over the following years the band took on new members, reaching a six-piece, but struggled to regain their earlier popularity. They initially split up in 1998 after releasing seven albums."

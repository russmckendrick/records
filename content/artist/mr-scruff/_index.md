title: "Mr. Scruff"
summary: "British DJ, producer, and artist. Born: 10 February 1972 in Macclesfield, Cheshire, England, UK. Carthy lives in Stockport, Greater Manchester, and studied fine art at the Psalter Lane campus of Sheffield Hallam University. Before he could make a living from his music alone, he worked as a shelf-stacker in the Burton Road branch of Kwik Save. His DJ name was inspired by his scruffy facial hair, as well as his trademark loose-lined drawing style. He has been DJ-ing since 1994, at first in and around Manchester, then nationally, and internationally. Known for his marathon DJ-ing sets , eclectic musical taste, love of a \"nice cup of tea\", and the quirky home-produced visuals and animations associated with his music. In an interview Carthy said: \"It’s about putting a lot of effort in and paying attention to detail. I get annoyed if I don’t take risks. I’m very hard on myself.\""

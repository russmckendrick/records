title: "Hooverphonic"
summary: "Hooverphonic is a belgian band that was established in 1995. Although they were initially characterized as a trip-hop group, they quickly broadened their sound to the point that they could no longer be categorized in a single genre. The band's original name was Hoover, but they eventually changed it to Hooverphonic because other bands were already using the Hoover moniker, they also wanted to avoid any legal concerns with the popular vacuum cleaner company. Hooverphonic's lineup has consisted of bassist Alex Callier, guitarist Raymond Geerts, and a number of lead singers. Among them were Liesje Sadonius , Geike Arnaert , No√©mie Wolfs , and Luka Cruysberghs ."

title: "Hooverphonic"
summary: "Hooverphonic is a Belgian band that was formed in October 1995. Though originally categorized as a trip hop group, they quickly expanded their sound to the point where they could no longer be described as a singular genre, but rather encompass alternative, electronica, electropop, rock, and a mixture of others. The band originally called themselves Hoover, but later changed their name to Hooverphonic after discovering other groups were already using the Hoover name and to avoid any legal issues with the vacuum cleaner company.
Since their formation, Hooverphonic's lineup consisted of bassist Alex Callier, guitarist Raymond Geerts, and various lead singers. Prominent ones included Liesje Sadonius , Geike Arnaert , No√©mie Wolfs , and Luka Cruysberghs .
The band were set to represent Belgium at the Eurovision Song Contest 2020 in Rotterdam with their song \"Release Me\". However, on March 18, 2020, the event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They instead represented Belgium in the Eurovision Song Contest 2021 with the song \"The Wrong Place\"."

title: "Bobby Brown"
summary: "Robert Barisford Brown Sr. is an American singer, songwriter and dancer. Brown, alongside frequent collaborator Teddy Riley, is noted as one of the pioneers of new jack swing: a fusion of hip hop and R&B. Brown started his career in the R&B and pop group New Edition, from its inception in 1978 until his exit from the group in December 1985.Once he started a solo career, Brown enjoyed commercial and critical success with his second album Don't Be Cruel which spawned five Billboard Hot 100 top 10 singles, including the number one hit \"My Prerogative\", and the Grammy Award-winning \"Every Little Step\". In 1989, Brown contributed two songs to the soundtrack of Ghostbusters II. Brown's next album Bobby spawned several singles including \"Humpin' Around\", \"Get Away\", and \"Good Enough\". However, despite going 3Ã— Platinum, sales of Bobby did not reach the level of its predecessor. Brown has sold over 50 million copies worldwide. Also in 1992, Brown married the superstar singer Whitney Houston, with whom he later had a daughter named Bobbi Kristina Brown. The couple's drug issues and domestic disputes made them tabloid fodder.Brown also appeared in the films A Thin Line Between Love and Hate and Two Can Play That Game. He returned to New Edition for a reunion album and tour from 1996 to 1997, and returned with all six members for another stint in 2005. Brown and Houston starred in the 2005 reality show Being Bobby Brown. Houston, who filed for divorce two years later in 2007, died in 2012, followed by the death of their daughter in 2015."

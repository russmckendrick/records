title: "Genesis"
summary: "Formed at Charterhouse School, Godalming, Surrey, South East England, UK in 1967, Genesis are among the top 30 highest-selling recording artists of all time. Their early work is characterized by complex song structures, elaborate instrumentation and the theatrical antics of founder member and vocalist , who left the band August 15, 1975. Unable to find a suitable replacement, it was drummer who assumed lead vocal duties. This change, as well as the departure of guitarist , two years later, saw the remaining three members move into more accessible pop-based music. This change in style resulted in a huge growth in Genesis' popularity throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. In 1996 Phil Collins left to concentrate on his solo work and other projects, leaving erstwhile bandmates Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks to forge ahead with new recruit; vocalist . This line-up lasted for one album only and Genesis soon found itself on hiatus after the poor performance and critical reaction of the new album. In 2006 – after years of speculation – Phil Collins, Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford reformed Genesis for the successful *Turn It On Again* tour. A reunion involving ex-members Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett remains much talked-about and unrealised.

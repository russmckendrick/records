title: "Slowdive"
summary: "Slowdive are a British rock band that formed in Reading, Berkshire, in 1989. The band consists of Rachel Goswell on vocals and guitar, Neil Halstead on vocals and guitar, Christian Savill on guitar, Nick Chaplin on bass guitar and Simon Scott on drums, all of whom have played on the band's debut studio album Just for a Day . Halstead is the band's primary songwriter.
The band is one of the most prominent within the shoegaze scene, which rose to prominence in England during the early 1990s. While the band's second studio album Souvlaki initially received mixed reviews upon release, it has since been recognized as one of the best releases of the 1990s and one of the greatest shoegaze albums of all time.The band broke up soon after the release of their third studio album Pygmalion in 1995, having seen Scott, Savill and Chaplin all depart the band prior. The remaining members continued under a more folk and country-influenced direction as Mojave 3. Slowdive reunited in 2014 to play the Primavera Sound festival, and released a self-titled studio album in 2017, their first in 22 years. The band's fifth studio album Everything Is Alive was released on 1 September 2023."

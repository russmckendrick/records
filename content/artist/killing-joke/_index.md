title: "Killing Joke"
summary: "Killing Joke are an English rock band from Notting Hill, London, England, formed in 1978 by Jaz Coleman , Paul Ferguson , Geordie Walker and Youth .
Their first album, Killing Joke, was released in 1980. After the release of Revelations in 1982, bassist Youth was replaced by Paul Raven. The band achieved mainstream success in 1985 with both the album Night Time and the single \"Love Like Blood\".
The band's musical style emerged from the post-punk scene, but stood out due to their heavier approach, and has been cited as a key influence on industrial rock. Their style evolved over many years, at times incorporating elements of gothic rock, synth-pop and electronic music, often bearing Walker's prominent guitar and Coleman's \"savagely strident vocals\". Killing Joke have influenced many later bands and artists, such as Metallica, Nirvana, Nine Inch Nails and Soundgarden. Coleman and Walker have been the only constant members of the band, but the current line-up features all four original members."

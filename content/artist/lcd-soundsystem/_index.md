summary: "LCD Soundsystem is an American rock band from Brooklyn, New York, formed in 2002 by James Murphy, co-founder of DFA Records. The band comprises Murphy , Nancy Whang , Pat Mahoney , Tyler Pope , Al Doyle , Matt Thornley , and Korey Richey . They are currently signed to both DFA and Columbia Records.
The band began by recording and releasing multiple singles from 2002 to 2004, the first of which was \"Losing My Edge\", one of their signature songs. This led up to the release of their 2005 self-titled debut studio album. It garnered critical acclaim and a Grammy Award nomination for Best Electronic/Dance Album. Their single \"Daft Punk Is Playing at My House\", which has become the band's most commercially successful single, received a Grammy nomination for Best Dance Recording. In the following year, LCD Soundsystem recorded and released \"45:33\", a forty-five minute-long composition that was a specially made \"workout track\" for Nike's Nike+ Original Run series. In 2007, the band released their second studio album, Sound of Silver, to critical acclaim and another Grammy nomination for Best Electronic/Dance Album.
In 2010, LCD Soundsystem released their third studio album, This Is Happening, which became their first top-ten album in the United States. In February 2011, the band posted a statement on its website announcing that it was disbanding following a large farewell concert at Madison Square Garden on April 2, 2011. The farewell concert is chronicled in the documentary film Shut Up and Play the Hits and was also made available as a live album titled The Long Goodbye, in April 2014.
After a series of rumors hinting at a possible reunion, in December 2015 the band released their first single in five years, \"Christmas Will Break Your Heart\". LCD Soundsystem later confirmed their reunion and announced an expanded tour, including appearances at several high-profile music festivals, and released their fourth studio album American Dream in September 2017. It went on to become their first number-one album in the United States. The album was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards and the single \"Tonite\" won for Best Dance Recording."

title: "Symarip"
summary: "Formed in the mid-sixties by seven musicians, Symarip first made their mark as **The Bees**, also supported Prince Buster on a UK tour in 1967. Soon after, the group was signed to President, changed their name to **The Pyramids** and found UK chart success with 'Train Tour To Rainbow City'. Throughout the remainder of the sixties and early seventies, the septet worked tirelessly, cutting discs under a number of aliases, most notably **Symarip** and **Seven Letters**. They moved to Germany in 1971, performing reggae and Afro-rock under the name **Zubaba**."

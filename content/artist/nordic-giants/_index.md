title: "Nordic Giants"
summary: "The elusive duo Loki and Roka bring their beautifully apocalyptic soundscapes alive in a rich project exploring the deep breadths of sonic and visual art. For Nordic Giants the performance is the thing, and as those who have seen the live show will attest, it is a visceral experience that goes beyond the normal descriptors. Each mind-blowing performance involves a chosen few short films, which are soundtracked live with atmospheric soundscapes. “Air whistles and whines around my ears, Distant echoes drift through endless minds, And magnetised to empty thoughts” Largely instrumental, A Séance Of Dark Delusions reflects the inspired musical experimentation and atmosphere of SigurRós, 65daysofstatic, Bjork and Pink Floyd. Nordic Giants bring a heavy orchestral brutality through progressive guitar, drum and brass, which are paired with beautiful and haunting electronics as they warp loops and end of the world samples through pattered keys. “The hollow sound resonates from morbid tone, And aloft the music goes, Notes bend and warp as the swell rolls” When they pull lyricism from the human world, Nordic Giants enlist the vocal features of artists, Saturday Sun , Nadine Wild Palmer , Freyja , and Beth Cannon . “Unborn thoughts sleep silently in the mind, A heavy cushion of warm unblemished noise, The heart beats slowly in time with the dull thud of drum” Loki - Keys, Synth,Trumpet & Loops Rôka Skulld - Cymbals & Skins, Bowed Guitar, Samples Pad"

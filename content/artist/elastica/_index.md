title: "Elastica"
summary: "Elastica were an English rock band formed in London in 1992 by ex-Suede members Justine Frischmann and Justin Welch. The band was stylistically influenced by punk rock, post-punk and new wave music. The band's members changed several times, with Frischmann and Welch being the only members who remained in Elastica from its formation to its dissolution.
Elastica quickly rose to prominence after the release of their debut single \"Stutter\" in November 1993, and the band's next three singles charted in the Top 20 of the UK Singles Chart. Their debut album Elastica was an immediate success and broke records for the fastest-selling debut album in the UK; the album also found success in the United States as part of the \"Second British Invasion\" during the mid-1990s, and produced the band's highest-charting US Hot 100 hit, \"Connection\". However, the band would later find itself in controversy over accusations of plagiarism, which were settled out-of-court.
Development on a follow-up album languished due to interpersonal disputes, line-up changes and Frischmann's heroin addiction during the late 1990s, before ultimately releasing their second album, The Menace , which was less well received critically or commercially. After struggling to come up with new material for a third album, the band amicably broke up in October 2001."

title: "Fleetwood Mac"
summary: "Founded in London in July 1967 , \"Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac\" instantly became a major force in the UK blues scene, along with their eponymous first album. Following \"Mr. Wonderful\" & \"Then Play On\" the driving force of Peter Green had deteriorated as he lapsed into a personal crisis by 1970. The group reorganized, under the leadership of Fleetwood, and slowly took on a new direction - away from the blues and into the mainstream of international popularity, known simply as **Fleetwood Mac**. Member/Dates: Peter Green Mick Fleetwood John McVie Jeremy Spencer Bob Brunning Danny Kirwan Christine McVie Bob Welch Bob Weston Dave Walker Doug Graves Lindsey Buckingham Stevie Nicks Billy Burnette Rick Vito Dave Mason, Bekka Bramlett Mike Campbell Neil Finn, Inducted into Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 1998"

title: "Tangerine Dream"
summary: "Founded by the late , Tangerine Dream is perhaps the premier exponent of \"electronic rock\" music of the \"Berlin School\". From their \"free-rock\" beginnings in the nascent \"krautrock\" scene to the eventual synthesizer-based trio which signed to , this German group can take significant credit in introducing synthesizer- and sequencer-based electronic music to most of the Western rock world. At the height of their success - during the mid to late 1970s - TD's spacey, pulsing music earned them a tenacious cult following. By the late Seventies, however, line-ups, and more importantly, the formula changed, tilting towards more conventional \"rock\" music. By the early 1980s, TD was primarily releasing influential soundtrack work, before settling into New Age content by mid-decade. Formed in Berlin in 1967, the initial line up included , and . Their compositions, or rather experimental improvisations, had roots in the psychedelia of London albeit with the \"krautrock\" twist. *Electronic Meditation* is perhaps a misnomer; traditional instrumentation of organ, drums, guitar, cello, flute were hardly electronic and \"freak out jamming\" is the more appropriate adjective, reflecting the confluence of Twentieth Century avant-garde music. Both Schnitzler and Schulze would depart after this album, with the latter forming and going on to become the other major proponent of the \"Berlin School\". Second album, *Alpha Centauri*, saw the addition of long-standing member replacing Schulze, while would come aboard for *Zeit*. Although unissued until the mid-1980s, *Green Desert* was recorded in 1973. The core of Froese, Franke and Baumann would sign to Virgin Records in 1973, and the subsequent release *Phaedra* would cement their style for years to come. Understated, droning keyboard and guitar melodies intertwined with ambient washes of reverberating electronic textures, utilizing synthesizers and sequencers, was typical of the TD sound. Compositions were long, melodic, pulsing pieces. temporarily replaced Baumann for an Australian tour in 1975. One highlight of the Virgin period was *Sorcerer*, a soundtrack to the film of the same name. After Baumann's departure in 1978, TD experimented with the formula on *Cyclone*, which saw the addition of , adding vocals and woodwinds and on drums. *Force Majeure* was the classic of this period. would join for *Tangram*. This line-up remained stable until the mid-1980s, as the group shifted toward more rhythmic textures. The increased emphasis on sequencers and rhythm in the first half of the 1980s divided fans, as did subsequent releases which veered heavily into relatively accessible, uplifting melodies. After a brief stint with from 1984 to 1988, TD signed to Baumann's label and then the equally New Agey , fully embracing digital textures and seeking to distance the group from its moody, psychedelic past. replaced Schmölling in 1985, and was in turn replaced by Froese's son in 1990. Franke left in 1987 over creative differences with Froese. After a mid-1990s move to Edgar Froese's own label , TD's reputation as a New Age band became less appropriate—father and son experimented with more modern sounds and revisited elements of past glories—but the group's artistic direction remained fairly entrenched in melodic pop-rock territory, with an increased use of acoustic instruments, particularly on stage. With Edgar Froese's death in 2015, the band continues, but with none of its original members."

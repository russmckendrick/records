title: "Forenzics"
summary: "Forenzics is a New Zealand musical project formed by Tim Finn and Eddie Rayner in 2020. It's a project that includes 'shades & echoes' of early Split Enz repertoire. The songs are combinations of new and re-imagined lyrics and music.
The 'guest' players on the recordings include former past member of Split Enz Noel Crombie. Phil Manzanera, who produced Split Enz's second album Second Thoughts is a featured guitarist on several songs. It also features Megan Washington.
Other players come via Eddie Rayner's instrumental ensemble Double Life - Mark Denison , Adrian Stuckey and Patrick Kuhtze . Double Life had created a bunch of inspired instrumental 'jams' which Eddie sent to Tim to imagine lyrics and melodies. This resulted in half the album's repertoire resulting from the jams and the other half using 'shades & echoes' of early Split Enz songs and ideas.
The name \"Forenzics\" is a play on the band's original name \"Split Enz\", a name they changed from \"Split Ends\" to represent New Zealand. The name and album name is to project the idea that they are using fragments from their past songs into their new ones."

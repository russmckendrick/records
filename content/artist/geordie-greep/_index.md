title: "Geordie Greep"
summary: "Geordie Wade Greep is an English musician. From 2017 to 2024, he was the frontman and lead guitarist of the rock band Black Midi, often considered part of the emerging wave of British rock music known as the Windmill scene..
While attending the BRIT School, he met Matt Kwasniewski-Kelvin, Cameron Picton, and Morgan Simpson; together they went on to form Black Midi. The group began performing live at Brixton pub The Windmill, the only venue to reply to Greep's emails requesting gigs.
After signing with Rough Trade Records in 2019, the band enjoyed critical acclaim with their three studio albums, Schlagenheim, Cavalcade, and Hellfire. Following the hiatus of Black Midi, Greep began a solo career and released his debut studio album, The New Sound via Rough Trade Records on 4 October 2024.
Greep is noted for his unique singing voice, partly due to his accent, which has been described as \"geographically unclassifiable\". He often writes dramatic narratives in his songs, many of which are centered on specific characters, as seen in the Black Midi song \"John L\", for example."

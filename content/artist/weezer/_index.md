title: "Weezer"
summary: "Weezer is an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1992. Since 2001, the band has consisted of Rivers Cuomo , Patrick Wilson , Scott Shriner , and Brian Bell .
After signing to Geffen Records in 1993, Weezer released their self-titled debut album, also known as the Blue Album, in May 1994. Backed by music videos for the singles \"Buddy Holly\", \"Undone – The Sweater Song\", and \"Say It Ain't So\", the Blue Album became a multiplatinum success. Weezer's second album, Pinkerton , featuring a darker, more abrasive sound, was a commercial failure and initially received mixed reviews, but achieved cult status and critical acclaim years later. Both the Blue Album and Pinkerton are now frequently cited among the best albums of the 1990s. Following the tour for Pinkerton, founding bassist Matt Sharp left the band and Weezer went on hiatus.
In 2001, Weezer returned with the Green Album with their new bassist, Mikey Welsh. With a more pop sound, and promoted by singles \"Hash Pipe\" and \"Island in the Sun\", it was a commercial success and received mostly positive reviews. After the Green Album tour, Welsh left for health reasons and was replaced by Shriner. Weezer's fourth album, Maladroit , incorporated a hard-rock sound and achieved mostly positive reviews, but weaker sales. Make Believe received mixed reviews, but its single \"Beverly Hills\" became Weezer's first single to top the US Modern Rock Tracks chart and their first to reach the top ten on the Billboard Hot 100.
In 2008, Weezer released the Red Album; its lead single, \"Pork and Beans\", became the third Weezer song to top the Modern Rock Tracks chart, backed by a Grammy-winning music video. Raditude and Hurley featured more \"modern pop production\" and songs co-written with other artists, achieved further mixed reviews and moderate sales. Everything Will Be Alright in the End and the White Album returned to a rock style that was reminiscent of their 90s sound mixed with modern alternative production and achieved more positive reviews; Pacific Daydream featured a more mainstream pop sound. In 2019, Weezer released an album of covers, the Teal Album, followed by the Black Album. In 2021, they released OK Human, which featured an orchestral pop sound and was met with critical acclaim, followed by the hard rock–inspired Van Weezer. In 2022, they released a series of extended plays based around the four seasons, a project known as SZNZ.
Weezer have sold 10 million albums in the US and over 35 million worldwide."

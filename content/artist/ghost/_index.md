title: "Ghost"
summary: "Ghost are a Heavy Metal/Rock band from Sweden formed in 2008. They are known for their own self-created mythology, their elaborate costumes, theatrical performances, and were known for keeping members anonymous. Each release lists the musicians as \"Nameless Ghouls\" and the frontman as \"Papa Emeritus / Papa Emeritus II / Papa Emeritus III / Cardinal Copia / Papa Emeritus IV\". Drawing influences from classic rock, classic metal and pop bands such as , Ghost differentiate themselves by merging the aforementioned genres, old and new, and satanic themes in their music giving them a unique sound. Tobias Forge revealed himself as \"The Man Behind The Mask of GHOST\" in first public interview on August 17, 2017 on Swedish Radio Channel P1, confirming that he is the lead singer and primary composer. The identities of the Nameless Ghouls were speculated upon by fans, but never officially confirmed either by the band or the musicians themselves until the end of the Imperatour Europe in 2022. A lawsuit brought against Forge by former members in 2017 identified a number of past members. Since 2017, Forge has been the only official member of Ghost. Due to legal conflicts, the band was briefly forced to release music under the Ghost B.C. name in the United States. They absolutely refused to use the name on any merchandise or in any other manner. **Fictional members/aliases**: Papa Emeritus 0 - Vocals, Saxophone Papa Emeritus I - Vocals Papa Emeritus II - Vocals Papa Emeritus III - Vocals Papa Emeritus IV - Vocals Nameless Ghouls: Instruments **Current Members**: Tobias Forge - Vocals **Known current touring musicians**: Guitar Ghoul - Guitar Ghoul - Multi-Ghoul - Drum Ghoul - Bass Ghoul - Keyboard/Backing Vocals/Keytar Ghuleh - Keyboard/Backing Vocals/Tambourine Ghuleh - **Known former touring musicians**: Fire Ghoul - Water Ghoul - , , , , Earth Ghoul - , Air Ghoul - Aether Ghoul - ,"

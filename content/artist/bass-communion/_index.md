title: "Bass Communion"
summary: "Bass Communion is a solo project of English musician Steven Wilson, best known for his lead role in the rock band Porcupine Tree. Records released under the name Bass Communion are in an ambient or electronic veinâ€”lengthy, drone-heavy compositions. They come about as experiments made from processing the sound of real instruments and field recordings.
Bass Communion's albums have often featured collaborations with other musicians, including Robert Fripp of King Crimson, saxophonist Theo Travis, Bryn Jones, and Vidna Obmana."

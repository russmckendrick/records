title: "Shed Seven"
summary: "Shed Seven are an alternative rock band, formed in York in 1990. They were one of the groups which contributed to the Britpop music scene of the 1990s. They originally comprised singer Rick Witter, guitarist/keyboardist Joe Johnson, bassist Tom Gladwin and drummer Alan Leach. Johnson was later replaced by Paul Banks, but a later line-up of the band included both Johnson and Banks.
They have achieved 15 Top 40 singles and five Top 40 albums in the UK. The band officially broke up in 2003, but reformed for a greatest-hits tour in July 2007. Shed Seven continued to play shows around Britain periodically until releasing a new studio album in 2017 with the announcement of Instant Pleasures. Their latest album, A Matter of Time, was released on 5 January 2024 and became the first number one album in their career.
Shed Seven released another album on 27th September of the same year, Liquid Gold, which went straight in at number one on the official UK album charts, giving them a second number one album of the year."

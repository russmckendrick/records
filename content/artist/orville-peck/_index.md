title: "Orville Peck"
summary: "Orville Peck is a country musician known for his baritone voice and flashy wardrobe. Peck, who released his self-produced debut album Pony in 2019, has been widely remarked upon for his tendency to wear a fringed “Lone Ranger” mask. Peck is often incorrectly described as being Canadian, due to having spent time in Toronto, but has stated that he was raised in South Africa. Peck openly identifies as queer and has been distinguished as an icon in a new age of country music. Despite attempts to unmask him, and various rumors surrounding his 'true' identity, Peck himself has never confirmed nor denied guesswork on his 'real' self."

title: "Henge"
summary: "Henge are probably unique in that three out of the four band members are aliens. Lead singer and guitarist, Zpor, originates from planet Agricular in Cosmic Redshift 7. Goo, who plays bass guitar and synth bass, is the last surviving Venusian, after mass extinction due to planet pollution. The drummer, Nom, is of the species Nommo and comes from Xylantia in the Sirius Star System. Grok, master of synthesizers, is the only native Earthling in the band. To Henge, planet earth is an experiment, they come in the name of Rave, in which they bring their gift of \"Cosmic Dross\" - a kind of music new to this planet! There are no earth words to describe these sounds, but you will learn how to LOVE and DANCE again! PS: Their base on earth is Manchester, UK."

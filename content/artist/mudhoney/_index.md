title: "Mudhoney"
summary: "American alternative rock band. Formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1988, following the split in the seminal Seattle band by vocalist Mark Arm and former guitarist Steve Turner. Though they never reached the fame of their label and city mates, Mudhoney were very much part of the early 90s grunge scene and are one of the most enduring groups."

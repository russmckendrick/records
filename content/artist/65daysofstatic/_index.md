summary: "65daysofstatic are a post-rock band from Sheffield, England. Formed in 2001, the band is composed of instrumentalists Paul Wolinski, Joe Shrewsbury, Rob Jones and Simon Wright.
The band's music has been described as noisy, electronic, guitar-driven instrumentals, interspersed with live drums and off-beat sampled drums akin to those of IDM artists, although they have continued to evolve their sound by incorporating electronic music, drum and bass and glitch music. They have been described as, \"a soundtrack to a new dimension, where rock, dance and electronica are equals.\"The band's first album, The Fall of Math, was released in September 2004, to critical acclaim, described as \"an album that can retain the dynamics, fraught tension and climactic explosiveness of its peers and influences, whilst still sounding like one of the most urgent and direct long-player releases of the year.\" The band released a further five studio albums, One Time for All Time, The Destruction of Small Ideas, We Were Exploding Anyway, Wild Light, replicr, 2019, and a soundtrack, Silent Running.
During the Game Awards 2014, it was announced that they would be providing the soundtrack for the video game No Man's Sky, followed by a live performance. An album containing music from the soundtrack, entitled No Man's Sky: Music for an Infinite Universe, was released in August 2016. During September 2017, the band announced new work involving algorithmic techniques, titled Decomposition Theory. Their latest studio album, replicr, 2019, was released on 27 September 2019."

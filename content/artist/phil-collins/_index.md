He was the drummer and later lead singer of the rock band Genesis and also has a career as a solo performer. Between 1982 and 1990, Collins achieved three UK and seven US number one singles as a solo artist. When his work with Genesis, his work with other artists, as well as his solo career is totalled, he had more US top 40 singles than any other artist during the 1980s. His most successful singles from the period include \"In the Air Tonight\", \"Against All Odds \", \"One More Night\", \"Sussudio\", \"Another Day in Paradise\" and \"I Wish It Would Rain Down\".
Born and raised in west London, Collins began playing drums at five and completed drama school training, which secured him various roles as a child actor, with his first major role at 13 as the Artful Dodger in the West End musical Oliver!. He then pursued a musical career, joining Genesis in 1970 as their drummer and becoming lead singer in 1975 following the departure of Peter Gabriel. Collins began a successful solo career in the 1980s, initially inspired by his marital breakdown and love of soul music, releasing the albums Face Value , Hello, I Must Be Going , No Jacket Required and ...But Seriously . Collins became, in the words of AllMusic, \"one of the most successful pop and adult contemporary singers of the '80s and beyond\". He also became known for a distinctive gated reverb drum sound on many of his recordings. In 1985, he was the only artist to perform at both Live Aid concerts. He also resumed his acting career, appearing in Miami Vice and subsequently starring in the film Buster . Collins left Genesis in 1996 to focus on solo work; this included writing songs for Disney's animated film Tarzan . He wrote and performed the songs, \"Two Worlds\", \"Son of Man\", \"Strangers Like Me\" and \"You'll Be in My Heart\", the latter of which earned him the Academy Award for Best Original Song. He rejoined Genesis for their Turn It On Again Tour in 2007. Following a five-year retirement to focus on his family life, Collins released his memoir in 2016 and completed his Not Dead Yet Tour in 2019. He then rejoined Genesis in 2020 for a second reunion tour, ending in March 2022.
Collins's discography includes eight studio albums that have sold 33.5 million certified units in the US and an estimated 150 million records sold worldwide, making him one of the world's best-selling artists. He is one of only three recording artists, along with Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson, who have sold over 100 million records both as solo artists and separately as principal members of a band. He has won eight Grammy Awards, six Brit Awards , two Golden Globe Awards, one Academy Award, and a Disney Legend Award.

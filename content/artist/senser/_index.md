title: "Senser"
summary: "Senser are an English rap rock band, originally formed in South West London from a group of friends in the late 1980s. The initial line-up was called ‘Senser Element’ and consisted of Nick Michaelson , Kerstin Haigh , Steve Morton , and James Barrett . The band played in Steve’s front room in his mums flat in Wimbledon Park. Steve’s mum and dad were classical violinists playing for the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra but his dad was ejected due to his outspoken and rebellious behaviour in rehearsals. Steve’s Dad; Garth, introduced Steve and his friends to the music of jazz legends like Miles Davis, Billy Cobham and Mahavishnu Orchestra and Psychedelic music from artists like Can, Jimi Hendrix, Hawkwind and Syd Barrett
In the 1980’s Steve Morton and James Barrett were also getting immersed in the London Electro scene which brought a fusion of Funk and Hip Hop sounds from New York. Steve also participated in beatbox battles and received respect for his skills at just 14 years old at the London Electro club ‘Spatz’. Early influences like Man Parish, Beastie Boys, NWA, West Street Mob, KRS1, Public Enemy added so much to the burgeoning sound of the band. At the same time Nick was honing his guitar skills to bands like Slayer, Anthrax and Black Sabbath. Kerstin had been a busker, singing 70’s rock music, having scoured through her family's vinyl collection of Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix & Crosby, Stills & Nash. Classical instruments like tabla and learning sitar, from her travels in India drew her to albums like Peter Gabriel’s soundtrack ‘Passion’ and singer, Sheila Chandra. These diverse and juxtaposed elements were being drawn together and the sound of Senser started to form.
Heitham Al-Sayed joined initially as a percussionist. What he really wanted to add was rapping, which was received with a mixed response, but Kerstin was positive that this would create something exciting in the music and Heitham started to write rhymes. The band were in ‘Albert Hall Studios’ when the steps to creating their first album ‘Stacked Up’ were taken, with an early tape recording ‘Music For The Mind And Body’ that included songs like; ‘Journey of Life’ and ‘What’s Going On’. In 1988 Steve Morton had to leave due to health issues and John Morgan joined. The band met Alan \"Hagos/Haggis\" Haggarty at the George Robey Pub in North London and liked his psychedelic treatment of the live sound. The band asked him if he wanted to join as a live producer who would bring the sound to the songs that were being written.
The band started to look for a DJ to join and in 1992 they were joined by Spiral Tribe D.J, Andy Clinton. The band toured in support of psychedelic rockers the Ozric Tentacles in 1992. In 1993, the band were signed to Ultimate Records."

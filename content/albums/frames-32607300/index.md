Frames is the third studio album by British progressive/alternative rock band Oceansize, released on 1 October 2007 on Superball Music. The album marks the first appearance of bassist Steven Hodson, following the departure of Jon Ellis in 2005.
In May 2008, the band re-released the album with an accompanying DVD, featuring a full performance of the album, a documentary focusing on the making of the album, and various live tracks. The package also includes an Oceansize sticker.
The band played the album in full on 18 October 2008 in Manchester as part of a trilogy of shows that celebrated the band's ten-year anniversary.

Vocalist/guitarist Mike Vennart states that: When Jon [Ellis] left I thought we were fucked. This is not a slight on Steven [Hodson], and I never said to anybody that I didn't think it would be as good any more, but I had a vibe about it. Then halfway through mixing it really started to make sense and I knew it would be something our fans would like. It's the kind of record they would want us to make, although I expect our hardcore fans to get it and hate and say "What have they done?" then a year later it'll be their favorite record.

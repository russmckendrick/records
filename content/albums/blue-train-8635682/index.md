Blue Train is a studio album by the jazz saxophonist and composer John Coltrane. It was released through Blue Note Records in January 1958. It is Coltrane's only session as leader for Blue Note. The recording took place at Rudy Van Gelder's studio on September 15, 1957.
Coltrane wrote four of the record's five tracks. His playing exhibits early elements of the signature style for which he later became known. Blue Train attained a gold sales certification by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2001.

The Blues Brothers journey that John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd began on <i>Saturday Night Live</i> grew into a multimedia phenomenon, but even with the comedy stripped away, the soundtrack to their 1980 cult-classic film still stands tall. When they’re not ceding the spotlight to R&B giants like Ray Charles (“Shake a Tail Feather”) and Aretha Franklin (“Think”), they stir blues, soul and rock ’n’ roll together with such unbridled energy, infectious enthusiasm and star-quality charisma that it’s impossible not to get caught up in the frenzy.

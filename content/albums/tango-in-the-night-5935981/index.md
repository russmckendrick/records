Please note that this record was originally pressed by Allied Record Company (according to the runout groove). But this is certainly a Record Service Alsdorf pressing.  Issued with a printed inner sleeve with lyrics and credits. Some copies issued with sticker advertising hit songs.  ℗ & © 1987 Warner Bros. Records Inc. for the US & WEA International Inc. for the world outside of the US.  [Inner sleeve & back cover]: UK: WX 65  [On runouts]: - Mastering/processing method derived from the runouts: Direct Metal Mastering [DMM]. - Originally mastered at Precision Lacquer. - Masters were plated at Specialty Records Corporation (SRC), mastered and pressed at Record Service Alsdorf as identified by their specific pattern in the runouts: Country code: SP-GER or SPGER. - Record Service Alsdorf used already existing US mothers. The processing of lacquer disc & 'metalwork' / 'plating' was made at Sheffield Lab Matrix as subcontractor for the Allied Record Company – which can be identified by etched string "△ #####-X" along with a "-SH#" and without the [Allied 'ɑ' logo]-stamp but with the manufacturer matrix number B-#####.   This album is dedicated to Judy Wong.  [This release](http://www.discogs.com/release/436642) is almost identical, but different text on the center label below song list on label reads here "All songs published (GB. only)."

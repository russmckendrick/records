Amorica (stylized as amorica.) is the third studio album by U.S. rock band The Black Crowes. Spawned from the band's unreleased Tall album sessions, Amorica was released on November 1, 1994, on American Recordings. Amorica reached gold status in the United States, shipping 500,000 copies.
The album cover notably featured a close-up photo of the pelvic region of a woman wearing a United States flag bikini bottom with pubic hair showing at the top. The photo was taken from the cover of the July 1976 issue of Hustler magazine. The album with this cover was subsequently banned from chain stores like Walmart and Kmart, resulting in the cover being censored with a solid black background displaying only the garment.
Other songs recorded during the Amorica sessions were "Feathers," "Tied Up and Swallowed" and "Chevrolet" (a Taj Mahal cover), which were later released as B-sides, bonus tracks or on compilation albums.

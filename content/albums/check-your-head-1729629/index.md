Coming into the reinvention of 1992’s <I>Check Your Head</I>, the Beastie Boys were in weird shape. <I>Paul’s Boutique</I> had flopped, the money from <I>Licensed to Ill</I> had mostly dried up, and the band were in the process of downsizing from top-dollar studios and a rented mansion in Beverly Hills to apartments and a makeshift rehearsal spot above a pharmacy across town in Atwater Village.<br />
In the absence of expectation came new kinds of freedom. They were playing instruments again, building loops from scratch—a project that not only tightened the album’s band-of-brothers spirit, but bridged their punk roots with jazz, funk and soul (“Groove Holmes”, “In 3’s”). They weren’t The Meters, and weren’t trying to pretend otherwise. But in the garage-band primitivism of the grooves lay a sense of willingness to step into situations where they could change, be challenged and grow. They were beginners again, and loving it. As Ad-Rock put it in the Apple TV+ documentary <I>Beastie Boys Story</I>, “Five years earlier, we’re at Madison Square Garden. Now we’re playing clubs. You’d think we’d be bummed out about it. But actually, falling off can be fun.”<br />
Like <I>Paul’s Boutique</I>, <I>Check Your Head</I> flowed like a mixtape, but rougher and noisier—a coarse flannel to <I>Paul’s Boutique</I>’s disco blouse. The rap-rock fusion played as comedy on <I>Licensed to Ill</I> was sober now (“So What’Cha Want”), a shift that not only helped define the expanding boundaries for alternative music in the 1990s (think Beck, think Rage Against the Machine), but also tapped into a reality that America was just waking up to: For white suburban kids who, in the past, might’ve only listened to rock music, hip-hop wasn’t foreign anymore, but the dominant sound in the culture. And here were the reformed ex-jerks bringing it home.

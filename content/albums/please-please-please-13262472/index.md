"Please Please Please" is a song by American singer Sabrina Carpenter from her sixth studio album, Short n' Sweet (2024). It was released through Island Records on June 6, 2024, as the second single from the album. Produced by Jack Antonoff, it was written by Antonoff, Carpenter, and Amy Allen. It is a country pop and yacht rock song with disco-pop influences, and sees Carpenter discuss her fears that her boyfriend will let his bad-boy reputation overshadow and destroy both their relationship and her pride.
The song received acclaim from music critics upon release. "Please Please Please" peaked at the top of the Billboard Hot 100, becoming her first number-one single on the chart. Outside of the United States, "Please Please Please" topped the charts in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, and the United Kingdom.

Unlike the original [m69821], which took its audio from various shows from that tour, this new release is the soundtrack to this one performance at Wembley, with the audio newly remixed by Giles Martin & Sam Okell at Abbey Road Studios.  This reissue removes the 'Shining Star' studio track and restores the lost 'Lately' track to complete the show.      Includes a 12 page book of images and notes and a download card

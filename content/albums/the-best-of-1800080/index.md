Judas Priest had been steadily gaining ground as one of the leading practitioners of 1970’s heavy metal, and as was the tradition in those days a live album was the surest way to establish market dominance: a live album screamed you had arrived. While each studio album to this point had its charm and showed a growing evolution within the group as a tighter, more concise unit, none captured the group’s infernal live energy. In later years, singer Rob Halford admitted to dubbing his vocals due to a poor sound mix, but the band’s two-guitar firepower is left raw and untouched. Definitive Priest tracks such as “Sinner,” “The Ripper,” “Victim of Changes” and their two career-defining covers — Joan Baez’s (!) “Diamonds and Rust” and the Peter Green-era Fleetwood Mac’s “Green Manalishi (with the Two-Pronged Crown)” — never sounded this loose and free in the studio. The band learned something from this experience. Why else would their next album, <I>British Steel</I>, be their first to capture this wilder side of the band in the studio? The expanded edition adds four tracks, including the band’s at-the-time newest classic “Hell Bent for Leather.”

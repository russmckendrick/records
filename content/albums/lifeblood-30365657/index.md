Lifeblood is the seventh studio album by Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers, released on 1 November 2004 by Sony Music UK. Two singles were released from the album: "The Love of Richard Nixon" and "Empty Souls".
While the album was met with generally positive reviews from critics, it is the band's least commercially successful album, peaking at number 13 in the UK Album Charts and has often been derided by the band members themselves.
An expanded and remastered edition was released in 2024 to mark its 20th anniversary.

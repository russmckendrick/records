The New Zealand singer/songwriter cuts a magisterial presence on her second LP. Possessing a steely and beautifully luminous voice, Reid takes each song under under graceful command. And there’s rich variety in this set. “Call the Days” is the stand-out; a stunning, brokenhearted folk tale that Reid navigates unbowed (“I have heard the mother’s tongue/she said: ‘baby don’t you come undone’”) and it’s supported by rousing bar room anthems (“Reaching Through”, “Holy Loud”), widescreen, country-flecked torch songs (“Track of the Time” and “Just To Feel Alive”) and gorgeous vignettes (“Ruby”).

Luck and Strange is the fifth studio album by the English guitarist and songwriter David Gilmour, released on 6 September 2024 by Sony Music. It was produced by Gilmour and Charlie Andrew. Gilmour said Andrew challenged him musically and was not intimidated by his past work with Pink Floyd.
Gilmour's wife, the novelist Polly Samson, wrote many of the lyrics, which she said addressed mortality and ageing. Their children contributed additional vocals and lyrics. The album also features keyboards recorded in 2007 by the Pink Floyd keyboardist, Richard Wright, who died in 2008. 
"The Piper's Call", "Between Two Points" and "Dark and Velvet Nights" were released as singles. Gilmour is due to begin a tour in September.

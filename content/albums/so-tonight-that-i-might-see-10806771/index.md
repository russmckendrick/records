Imagine a jukebox in Route 66's loneliest roadhouse, and it might sound a lot like Mazzy Star’s second album. Tambourines roll at tumbleweed tempos, a lap steel gently weeps and Hope Sandoval sings with the fluid grace of a waking dream. The title track is a psychedelic swirl of feedback and gentle murmurs, and “Mary of Silence” goes even deeper into Doors-inspired drone rock. On “Fade into You”, Sandoval’s weary voice falls across acoustic strumming like velvet curtains brushing an empty dance floor.

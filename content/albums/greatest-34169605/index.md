When Duran Duran emerged from Birmingham, England in the early 1980s, they were linked with the short-lived New Romantic movement—a nightclub-based trend founded on outrageous fashion choices and music that modernised ’70s glam and art rock. The quintet didn’t necessarily shy away from the association: They gleefully wore frilly shirts and swashbuckling pirate gear, and referenced “some new romantic looking for the TV sound” in the lyrics of their 1981 debut single, “Planet Earth”.

In reality, however, Duran Duran were focused on substance over looks, aspiring to create music that combined the sound of punk agitators Sex Pistols and disco icons Chic. This was a lofty goal, but the band’s 1981 self-titled debut album does confound expectations in the form of sleek basslines, glittery guitars and atmospheric synth work.

Working with producer-engineer Colin Thurston—whose CV included albums by David Bowie, Magazine and The Human League—Duran Duran emphasised their individual strengths. Guitarist Andy Taylor’s bold, ripping guitar riffs propelled “Planet Earth” and “Careless Memories”, while Nick Rhodes’ keyboard-work offered multiple emotions: playful on “Sound of Thunder”, eerie on the proggy “Night Boat”. The rhythm section of bassist John Taylor and drummer Roger Taylor (no relation to each other or Andy) favoured liquid grooves that added a danceable edge, especially on the glammy post-disco gem “Girls on Film”. And the poetry throughout was provided by vocalist Simon Le Bon, who dipped into his trusty writing notebook for mysterious, moody lyrics that embraced the future while being somewhat wary of the past.

Although Roxy Music is an obvious influence—and the atmospheric art-school of “Tel Aviv” especially conjures the cult UK band Japan—the album felt like a strikingly modern fresh start. Upon its release, <i>Duran Duran</i> was a Top 10 hit in Australia and the UK, and secured the band’s future beyond the New Romantic era. Success in America was initially elusive—in fact, the album didn’t even chart—but after 1982’s <i>Rio</i> became a hit, <i>Duran Duran</i> retroactively became a hit, albeit with a slightly different tracklist that included 1983’s Beatles-esque No. 1 hit “Is There Something I Should Know?”

The Best of OMD is a compilation album by English electronic band Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), released in 1988; marking a decade since the band's beginnings. The record essentially delineates the group's experimental early years from their pop-oriented later work: side one features recordings from 1979 to 1984, while side two is drawn from the group's 1984–1988 efforts.
The album was a worldwide success, becoming a Top 5 hit across Europe and achieving 3× platinum sales in the United Kingdom and gold status in the United States. "Dreaming" was released as a single and made little impact on the UK charts, reaching No. 50, but it was a hit in the US (No. 16), Germany (No. 26) and South Africa (No. 2).
The Best of OMD was named by The Quietus and Classic Pop as one of the best compilation albums in history.

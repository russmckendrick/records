For their second album, Chicago shortened their name (from Chicago Transit Authority) and broadened their sound. “Movin’ In” and “25 or 6 to 4” are brassy pop songs with a big band makeover, bristling with punchy horns and driving bass. The group truly stretched out on “Memories of Love”, an orchestrated multipart song cycle that showcased their classical music influences.

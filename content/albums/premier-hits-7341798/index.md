The Premier Hits is a compilation album by Gary Numan released in March 1996 on the Polygram TV record label. The album reached No 21 in the UK Albums Chart, leaving the chart after three weeks. It currently stands as the best selling compilation by Gary Numan. The album was promoted by the re-released 1987 remixed version of "Cars" ('E' Reg Model), re-titled as the 'Premier Mix' in a TV advert campaign for Carling Premier lager. The single reached No 17, making the third time that "Cars" has reached the top 40 in the UK Singles Chart.
All the tracks were digitally remastered in November 1995 and the enclosed twelve page colour booklet contains photos and an essay by long term Numan collaborator Steve Malins. All the single sleeves are also illustrated with the unexplained exception of Stormtrooper in Drag and Love Needs No Disguise.
The album was reissued in 1997 by Beggars Banquet as Premier Hits with a different sleeve design (again taken from the Dance album photo session). Currently the album stands as the most famous and highest selling Gary Numan compilation, and was certified Silver by the BPI in March 2015.
The album was again reissued in August 2015 by Beggars Banquet as Premier Hits as a 2LP Vinyl set, while seeing a change of the track listing. It involves the removal of the "Cars" 'Premier Mix' while the addition of four bonus tracks, “Metal”, "We Are So Fragile", "Films" and "Me, I Disconnect From You".

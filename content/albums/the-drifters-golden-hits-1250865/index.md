The Drifters' Golden Hits is a 1968 compilation album by American doo wop/R&B vocal group The Drifters. The collection of the bands' later hits charted at #22 on Billboard's "Black Albums" chart and at #122 on the "Pop Albums" chart.
The album was included in Robert Christgau's "Basic Record Library" of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981). In 2012, Rolling Stone listed the album at #459 in its list of "Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time". Originally released on the Atlantic label, the album has been re-released on CD by Atlantic.  A Drifters' compilation by the same name was released by Intercontinental records in 1996, but it has a different track listing.

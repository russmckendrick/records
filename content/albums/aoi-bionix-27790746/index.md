On their sixth album, 2001’s <i>AOI: Bionix</i>—the second volume in a never-completed trilogy—De La Soul took on a gently robotic feel for their head-nodding-est project ever. There’s a little bit of hedonism in here, with a few breezy songs about what they used to call “buddy”: “Pawn Star” is like X-rated Curtis Mayfield, “What We Do (For Love)” features Slick Rick with an adult update of “Children’s Story”, mild hit “Baby Phat” is a celebration of thicker women. And there’s a little weed smoke in the air, too, on “Peer Pressure”—though, in true Delacratic fashion, Posdnuos abstains, even when going toe-to-toe with Cypress Hill’s B-Real. However, De La Soul had not turned into a mellow party crew, as the gospel-tinged “Held Down” and the child-chant-abetted “Trying People” attest—they are existential soul jams with raps about jealousy, growth and the changing rap world.

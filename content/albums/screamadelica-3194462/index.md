Before acid house, Primal Scream were your average, jangly psych-rock act. Then rave hit and the late, great Andrew Weatherall signed on to produce their third album, <i>Screamadelica</i>, and a generation's collective mind was blown. Their roots are evident in the Stones-style blues rock of "Movin' On Up", but the '60s quickly melt away as they dive into house beats, synth bleeps, dubbed-out remixology and the mind-bending chillout bliss of "Higher Than the Sun" and "I'm Comin' Down". Dancing in muddy fields would never be the same again.

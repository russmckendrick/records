It might seem like SoCal stoner-rock kings Fu Manchu live on a planet populated exclusively by skate rats, surf dudes and beach babes, but a closer examination suggests that this planet might actually be in another galaxy. On their 12th album, the fuzzed-out riffs and hot cowbell action of "Intelligent Worship", time-traveling astral rock of "Clone of the Universe" and trippy 18-minute space jam "Il Mostro Atomico"—featuring an unprecedented guest appearance from Rush guitarist Alex Lifeson—are out of this world.

Solo: A Star Wars Story (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) is the soundtrack album to the 2018 film of the same name directed by Ron Howard, which is the second instalment in the Star Wars anthology series. The score is composed by John Powell, with Han Solo's theme conducted and composed by John Williams, whom he had collaborated with for several Star Wars films. Williams composed several demos not included in the soundtrack but later released in the deluxe edition. Besides composing the original themes, Powell also incorporated Williams' music from previous Star Wars films.
Walt Disney Records released the soundtrack album on May 25, 2018, and debuted at third position on soundtracks chart from UK's Official Charts Company. It further received positive response and Powell won the Film Music Composition of the Year award by the International Film Music Critics Association. It was followed by a deluxe edition release on November 20, 2020, that featured Williams' additional cues and unedited demos from the score, and a 2-LP vinyl album was published by Mondo in January 2021.

Unblackened  is a live acoustic album by American heavy metal band Black Label Society. It was recorded live on March 6, 2013, at Club Nokia in Los Angeles, and released on September 24, 2013.
Disc 1 consists of live tracks and disc 2 also consists of live tracks among six newly recorded songs, three of which are re-recordings of previously released songs from the band's studio albums.
The album was announced back in 2012, but the release was delayed due to the postponement of the show, which was settled to be recorded in August. Black Label Society started the pre-ordering of the album in August 2013, also offering a deluxe edition box set containing a double live CD pack, a DVD of the show, a replica of Zakk Wylde's pewter dagger necklace, a photo book with photos taken from the show, and a custom package.
On August 9, 2013, "Ain't No Sunshine When She's Gone" was released as a single through iTunes in North America.

| Notes | Vinyl Vault is proud to present Unblackened, the new live album from Zack Wylde’s legendary heavy rock outfit Black Label Society recorded in 2013 at Los Angeles’ Club Nokia. BLS present their songs in a way never heard before, with greater use of acoustic instrumentation and a stripped down approach that will leave you floored by the subtlety and intricacies of their songwriting. Despite this the band retain their intensity and lose none of their power with stinging, searing solos that fans know and love featuring throughout on classics such as ‘Stillborn, ‘The Blessed Hellride’ and ‘Throwin’ It All Away’.   This 3LP set also features six additional tracks not found on the DVD concert release including two acoustic versions of “Queen Of Sorrow” and “Won’t Find It Here,” and covers of Leon Russel’s “Song For You” and “Aint No Sunshine” by Bill Withers.   |

The Dronne (French pronunciation: [dʁɔn], also Drône, [dʁon]; Occitan: Drona) is a 201-kilometre (125 mi) long river in southwestern France, right tributary of the Isle, which itself is a tributary of the Dordogne. The source of the Dronne is in the north-western Massif Central, east of the town of Châlus (south-west of Limoges) at an elevation of 510 metres (1,670 ft). It flows south-west through the following départements and towns:

Haute-Vienne
Dordogne: Saint-Pardoux-la-Rivière, Brantôme, Ribérac
Charente: Aubeterre-sur-Dronne
Charente-Maritime
Gironde: Coutras
The Dronne flows into the Isle in Coutras.
Among its tributaries are the Lizonne and the Côle.

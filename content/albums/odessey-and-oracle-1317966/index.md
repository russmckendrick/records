Odessey and Oracle is the second studio album by the English rock band the Zombies. It was released in the UK on 19 April 1968, by CBS Records and in the US on 15 July 1968, by Date Records. The album was recorded primarily between June and August 1967 at EMI (now Abbey Road Studios) and Olympic Studios in London.
The Zombies, having been dropped from Decca Records, financed these sessions independently. After signing with CBS, two singles and later the album itself were released to critical and commercial indifference, and the band quietly dissolved. A third single from the album, "Time of the Season", became a surprise hit in the United States in early 1969 after CBS staff producer Al Kooper recommended it be released on Date Records.
The album gradually achieved critical praise and a cult following, and has since become one of the most acclaimed albums of the 1960s. It was ranked 80th on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003. When Rolling Stone revised its list in 2020, the album ranked 243rd.

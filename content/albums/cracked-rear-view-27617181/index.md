Jangly guitars, good-time riffs, and frontman Darius Rucker’s gruff growl combine for an easygoing, laidback collection of lightly Southern-fried pop. Upbeat tracks like “Only Wanna Be with You” and “Running from an Angel” bring together gentle grooves with lovelorn lyrics, while ballads like the anthemic “Hold My Hand” and the wistful “Not Even the Trees” showcase Rucker’s emotional range. A little bit country, a little bit rock 'n' roll, <i>Cracked Rear View</i> has fun even when it’s dealing with serious matters of the heart.

A deluxe version of XTC's 1982 classic, English Settlement.   Including:   * 2 x 33rpm, 200g heavyweight vinyl  * 12" 16 page booklet with song notes by band members  * Lyric sheet  * 2016 cut from original half-inch master sources  * CD mastered from the same original master sources  * All contents packaged in a sturdy slipcase   While looking for the (still 'lost in the archives') multi-track tapes to enable Steven Wilson to undertake new stereo and 5.1 surround mixes of the album, the original half-inch master tapes were discovered and used as source masters from which engineer John Dent cut new lacquers for this heavyweight vinyl edition.

<i>In Through the Out Door</i>, Led Zeppelin’s final studio album, was also one of the few pre-SoundScan era releases to debut atop the Billboard chart. Coming after a three-year-plus wait, the record delivers some of Zeppelin’s most ambitious work. The Latin-tinged “Fool in the Rain” again demonstrates the quartet’s unique approach to dance music, while the pomp-rock spectacular “Carouselambra” allows John Paul Jones’ keyboards to take the spotlight. The definitively silly country romp “Hot Dog,” though, is maybe the least typical thing to ever come from this always surprising band. And the album's closer, “I’m Gonna Crawl,” proves that Led Zep had hardly forgotten the meat-and-potatoes thud that first won them an audience. If a great band need leave the stage, let it always be with such happily venturesome sounds.

Each cover shows an alternate angle of a man in a bar. The scenario was photographed from 6 different viewpoints within the bar and then 6 different sleeve variations were created (with the letters A–F at the top of the spine denoting each variation). The large format insert features a 'magic' ink in different colours which appear on the design when gently wetting.   Runouts are etched.

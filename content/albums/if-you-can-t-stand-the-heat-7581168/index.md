If You Can't Stand the Heat... is the eleventh studio album by English rock band Status Quo.  Recorded
at Wisseloord Studios, Hilversum, Holland, and produced by Pip Williams, it was released in October 1978 and reached number three in the UK Albums Chart.  The sleeve notes that Aphex Aural Exciter was used in the recording process. Unusually for a Status Quo record, a brass section, the David Katz Horns, was used, as well as a backing vocal trio: Jacquie Sullivan, Stevie Lange, and Joy Yates.
"Again and Again" was the first single to be released from the album and reached number 13 in the UK Singles Chart.
The second single to be released from the album was an edited version of "Accident Prone", which peaked at number 36 in the UK.

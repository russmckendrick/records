According to the "320" stamped in the runouts, which reffers to Universal M & L, Germany, this reissue was most likely released sometime between 1999 and 2005, as Universal M & L, Germany, established in 1999 and then became EDC, Germany in 2005.  Includes foldout poster but unlike the original issue this variation has no printed inner sleeves.  Some of the pressings came with wrongly centered labels on both sides of the first record.  On the B-side the label comes over the last part of the last song.

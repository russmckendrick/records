[Hype sticker] Featuring new cover art by [Roger Dean](https://www.discogs.com/artist/1826912) The [a227943] Remixes on vinyl for the first time [m=34991] [m=34934] [m=35006] [m=35036] [m=35126] R1 562476  Includes remixed versions of: [m=34991] (1971), [m=34934] (1971), [m=35006] (1972), the double album [m=35036] (1973), and [m=35126] (1974). Each album features remixed audio by renowned producer [a227943], released on vinyl for the first time.  The outer box features artwork created specifically for the set by [Roger Dean](https://www.discogs.com/artist/1826912), who also created new cover art for [m=35006] and [m=35036], and reworked cover art for [m=34991], [m=34934], and [m=35126].  Made in EU [printed on all disc labels] Printed in U.S.A. [printed on The Yes Album rear cover]  This release differs from the [EU release](https://www.discogs.com/release/12231071) based on the cat# printed on the box set spine and hype sticker - this release shows "R1 562476" whereas the EU release shows "081227934019".  The track durations on the rear cover of The Yes Album do not match the durations indicated on the disc labels. There is also a misprint on side L label (Relayer, side B): track L2 ("To Be Over") is numbered "1" rather than "2".  Runouts are etched.

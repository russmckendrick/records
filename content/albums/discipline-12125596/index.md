Discipline is the eighth studio album by English progressive rock band King Crimson, released on 2 October 1981 by E.G. Records in the United Kingdom and by Warner Bros. Records in the United States.
This album was King Crimson's first following a seven-year hiatus. Only band co-founder and guitarist Robert Fripp and drummer Bill Bruford remained from the previous incarnation. They were joined by two American musicians: vocalist, guitarist and frontman Adrian Belew, previously a member of Frank Zappa and David Bowie's backing bands and a touring member of Talking Heads, and bassist, Chapman Stick player, and backing vocalist Tony Levin, a session musician Fripp had met while both were working with Peter Gabriel. The album introduced a new sound for the band, influenced by new wave, post-punk, minimalism and Indonesian gamelan music, while retaining an experimental character, helping lay the groundwork for what would eventually become known as post-progressive rock.

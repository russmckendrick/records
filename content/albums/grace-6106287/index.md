Grace is the only studio album by the American singer-songwriter Jeff Buckley, released on August 15, 1994 in Europe and on August 23, 1994 in the United States by Columbia Records. It was produced by Buckley and Andy Wallace. 
After moving from Los Angeles to New York City in 1991, Buckley amassed a following through his performances at Sin-Ã©, a cafe in the East Village, and signed a record deal in 1993. He recorded Grace in Bearsville Studios in Woodstock, New York, with musicians including Gary Lucas, Mick Grondahl, Michael Tighe and Matt Johnson. It includes versions of the jazz standard "Lilac Wine", the hymn "Corpus Christi Carol" and the 1984 Leonard Cohen song "Hallelujah". 
Grace did not meet Columbia's sales expectations, reaching number 149 on the US Billboard 200, and initially received mixed reviews. After Buckley's death in 1997, the popularity and critical standing of Grace grew, and it was praised by musicians including Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, Bob Dylan and David Bowie. By 2011, it had achieved sales of two million, and in 2016 it was certified platinum in the US.  
Rolling Stone included Grace in three of its lists of the 500 greatest albums and named Buckley's version of "Hallelujah" one of the 500 greatest songs. In 2014, Buckley's version of "Hallelujah" was inducted into the American Library of Congress' National Recording Registry.

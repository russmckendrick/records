| Notes | 7 record box set features all 6 of Jellyfish's UK singles, pulled from the two albums – 1990’s Bellybutton and 1993’s Spilt Milk, including the 4-track ‘Scary-Go-Round’ EP,  all pressed on 'multi-coloured' 7" vinyl.   Also included is a unique bonus disc featuring two covers, one of which is ‘Think About Your Troubles’, a tribute to Harry Nilsson, recorded by Roger Manning Jr and Andy Sturmer in February 1994, a few weeks after Nilsson’s death (“it was the last thing Jellyfish did as a group”, Roger recalls).  The audio has all been remastered especially for vinyl and as well as the singles in picture sleeves, the set includes a 64-page book with very detailed and entertaining track-by-track guides (not the same as those in the 2015 Omnivore CDs) from Roger Manning Jr, Jason Falkner, Chris Manning, Tim Smith, Eric Dover and band members and a newly written essay by Maura K. Johnston.   The [68 pages including the cover] soft-back book is packed with previously unseen photographs, rare memorabilia and promotional items, plus a 3D poster & Jellyfish branded 3D glasses.  Limited to 1,000 units worldwide and is a one-time pressing (A black vinyl edition was later released on 28th October 2022).  All seven records are in picture sleeves with die-cut white paper inner sleeves. All seven records have 'artwork' Side B labels, with track information on Side A labels [Side A (This Side) / Side B (Other Side)]  Live tracks are denoted with an asterisk on the rear of the box as " * Live tracks " |

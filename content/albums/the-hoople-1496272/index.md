The Hoople is the seventh and final studio album by British rock band Mott the Hoople. The album peaked in the UK Albums Chart at No. 11, whilst its highest chart rating in the US was No. 28. It was the 85th best selling album of 1974 and was voted 16th best album of 1974 by the readers of Creem magazine. A remastered and expanded version was released by Sony BMG on the Columbia Legacy label in Europe in 2006.  It was the only album to feature guitarist Ariel Bender, replacing Mick Ralphs (who nevertheless appeared on two tracks), and the last album to feature vocalist Ian Hunter before his departure for a solo career.
The album's cover features a stylised portrait of Kari-Ann Moller (with the band members in her hair), who also graces the cover of Roxy Music's 1972 debut album.

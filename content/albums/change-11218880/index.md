Change is the debut solo album by Cindy Wilson of The B-52's. Crowdfunded by PledgeMusic, it’s her third solo effort after the release of two EPs: Sunrise (released in September 2016) and Supernatural (released in February 2017). 
Wilson has stated that she had been working on the album for several years with her solo band, first as a collaboration for gigs and then a more consistent project. Change features ten tracks, consisting of eight original compositions and two covers (New Colony Six’s “Things I’d Like to Say” and Oh-OK’s “Brother”). Although it did not chart on any major charts, critics praised the low-tempo synth electronica direction that Wilson took on this release and the album achieved a 74% positive score on Metacritic. An official video was released for "Brother".

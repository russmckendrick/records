180 gram vinyl housed in a gatefold jacket and issued in a white poly lined inner sleeve. The gatefold jacket is sealed with a white bellyband including the following printed text: Front : Led Zeppelin Houses Of The Holy Back : [Atlantic logo] 8122796573 Includes an 11" x 11" thick velum style paper insert with lyrics and band line-up.  Runouts are entirely etched, and where [l313190]'s faintly inscribed geometric marks appear, these are mirrored: Variant 2: Side A '51▽', side B '1 11 -' Variant 3: Side A '3=1', side B '4V1' Variant 4: Side A '3+X', side B '4 T T' Variant 5: Side A '2VT', side B '41–' Due to the nature of the hand etching, it can sometimes appear that there is a space between the letters and numbers of the Optimal Media GmbH identifiers. However, as per the Optimal Media GmbH label page, their runout scheme "is in fact always without spaces."

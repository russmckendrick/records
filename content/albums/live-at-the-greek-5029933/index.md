Live at the Greek: Excess All Areas is a double live album by Jimmy Page and the Black Crowes, released by musicmaker.com on 29 February 2000 and reissued by TVT Records on 4 July 2000.
On the October 18th and 19th dates of their 1999 tour , at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles, Jimmy Page and the Black Crowes recorded songs from their performances, which were released on a live album in 2000. Songs performed included material from the Led Zeppelin and the Black Crowes catalogues and old blues and rock standards. "I didn't really have that much fun doing it," said singer Chris Robinson. "It was alright, and Jimmy's a phenomenal guitarist, but to me it was just a job. I'm not a big fan of Robert Plant's lyrics or his singing, so that part of it was a little boring for me."
Contractual restrictions with the Black Crowes’ record company, Columbia Records, prevented their own songs (such as "Wiser Time", "No Speak, No Slave", "Remedy", and "Hard to Handle”), performed with Page at the Greek Theatre shows, from being included on the album.
The version of the double CD released later in 2000 featured a different running order, an extra song, an enhanced QuickTime video and photographs taken during the concert. The Japanese version of the album adds "Misty Mountain Hop" and "In the Light", recorded in 2000.
Bassist Sven Pipien was fired between the two releases of the album and was airbrushed out of the group photograph in the centerfold of the TVT Records version and all subsequent vinyl reissues. The original image appearing on the musicmaker.com release can be viewed on a blog about Jimmy Page.

Archive Cardiacs (or simply Archive) is a compilation album by English rock band Cardiacs. The album is composed of early tracks by the band recorded from 1977 to 1979. The tracks were compiled from Cardiacs' demo albums The Obvious Identity (1980) and Toy World (1981), as well as four pieces recorded by Tim Smith and Dominic Luckman for a side project that never saw fruition.
The album was originally released on cassette in 1989 exclusively available to the Cardiacs Yousletter Family and was reissued on CD in 1995.

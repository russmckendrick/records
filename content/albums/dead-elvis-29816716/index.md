Dead Elvis is the debut album by British band Death in Vegas. It was released on 10 March 1997 in the United Kingdom and on 16 September 1997 in the United States.

The music video for "Dirt" was a minor hit on MTV's 120 Minutes. "GBH" was featured on the soundtrack for the 1998 American comedy-thriller film Homegrown.
As of July 2013, it was certified silver by British Phonographic Industry for 60,000 sold units in UK.

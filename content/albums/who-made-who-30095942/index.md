Until the 2010 <i>Iron Man 2</i> soundtrack, this was closest thing that AC/DC ever made to a greatest hits album. <i>Who Made Who</i> was released in 1986 as the soundtrack to the first movie directed by famed horror novelist Stephen King. While that film (<i>Maximum Overdrive</i>) was not such a rousing success, the soundtrack was a massive hit and it also gave us one of the band’s most enduring tracks, “Who Made Who”. This was the band at their mid ’80s finest, creating a driving hard rock anthem with Johnson’s voice tearing through the firmament. Big hits like “You Shook Me All Night Long”, “Hells Bells” and “For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)” fill in the spaces while a Bon Scott classic “Ride On” and some instrumental tracks composed specifically for the film round out this portrait of the band in their mid-’80s prime.

Having explored musical eclecticism as far as any traditional punk band can, East Bay legends Rancid make the short, meaty album you probably thought they made 30 years ago. There are pirates (“The Bloody & Violent History”), gang choruses (“Mud, Blood, & Gold”, “Prisoners Song”), spiky bass runs (“Eddie the Butcher”) and enough trains and knives to fill a tattooist’s flash book. The sound is simple and indestructible, and the moral remains that camaraderie and brotherhood transcends all (“Hear Us Out”). And though he’s been sober since his twenties, the 57-year-old Tim Armstrong still slurs his declarations with the resilience of someone beaten to the edge of consciousness but still ready to get up and throw a punch.

Shangri-La Dee Da is the fifth studio album by the American rock band Stone Temple Pilots. It was released on June 19, 2001, through Atlantic Records. Recording took place throughout the winter and spring of 2001 in a Malibu villa. It was the band's fifth and final album to be produced by Brendan O'Brien and their last before breaking up in 2003.
Originally planned to be a double album, Shangri-La Dee Da contains thirteen tracks which range from heavy, distorted songs to psychedelic-inspired rock and acoustic ballads. "Days of the Week" and "Hollywood Bitch" were released as singles, with the former becoming a rock radio hit.
While Shangri-La Dee Da was not as commercially successful as its predecessors, it still sold well, reaching the top ten in the US and the top five in Canada and being certified Gold in both countries. The album received positive reviews from critics, with many praising the variety of moods across the album. The band toured throughout the rest of 2001 to promote the album, including embarking on the Family Values Tour with Linkin Park and others in October and November of that year.

| Notes | Taking elements from the recent musical developments with The Pineapple Thief, as well as an ambition to experiment with his own sound, All This Will Be Yours is an intensely personal album from Bruce Soord.   Described by Soord as an observational record, it is inspired by the joy felt by the birth of his third child juxtaposed by the local deprivation in his hometown. Whilst on walks in Yeovil, Bruce took field recordings as he witnessed the ‘incarcerated souls’ shuffling to local drug den ‘number 158’, the screaming children on their commute to school, the incessant sounds of sirens, and an old man singing as he walked past his house.   The sound of All This Will Be Yours features contemporary production elements, alongside acoustic guitars delicately layered with samples. Ever present are Soord's familiar vocals, which deliver an emotive and accessible view into his contrasting feelings when writing about austerity whilst his tranquil newborn dozed in the studio.    The audio has been recorded as two continuous linear pieces to replicate the pleasure of listening to an album on vinyl, and was mastered by fellow The Pineapple Thief member Steve Kitch.   180g vinyl edition in single sleeve packaging with a printed inner bag.

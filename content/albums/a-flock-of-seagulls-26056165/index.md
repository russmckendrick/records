A Flock of Seagulls are an English new wave band formed in Liverpool in 1979. The group, whose best-known line-up comprised Mike Score, Ali Score, Frank Maudsley and Paul Reynolds, hit the peak of their chart success in the early 1980s.
In an Interview with the Worchester Magazine (2017) , Mike Score explain explains where the band name comes from – 

my favorite band was The Stranglers. One of their songs was called “Toiler on the Sea.” We were at one of their concerts (The singer) yells out, “a flock of seagulls.” We were in the front row. He looked like he looked right at us and called out, “a flock of seagulls.” We took it as a sign. Originally, were called Level 7, but Level 42 has just put their album out. We knew we were going to have to change our name … Strangely enough, from that moment on, everybody noticed us. Everyone was like, 'Wow, what a strange name.' I think the name made people want to hear what we were about.
The group had a string of international hit singles including "I Ran (So Far Away)" (1982), "Space Age Love Song" (1982), "Wishing (If I Had a Photograph of You)" (1982), and "The More You Live, the More You Love" (1984). Their video for "I Ran (So Far Away)" received airplay on MTV during the Second British Invasion. The band won a Grammy Award in 1983 for their instrumental "D.N.A." (1982).
In 2018, the members of the original lineup assembled to record the album Ascension with the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. In 2021, the original lineup again reunited temporarily to record another album with the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra, String Theory.

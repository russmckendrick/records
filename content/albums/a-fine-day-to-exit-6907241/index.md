A Fine Day to Exit is the sixth album by the British rock band Anathema. It was released on 9 October 2001 through Music for Nations.
This is the only occasion where an Anathema album has John Douglas credited as a writer for around half of the songs. He wrote "Pressure", "Looking Outside Inside", "Panic" (co-written with Daniel Cavanagh), the title track and the hidden acoustic track at the end of "Temporary Peace" called "In the Dog's House".
It is the last album with bassist Dave Pybus, and the first with keyboardist Les Smith.

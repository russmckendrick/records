Betty is the third studio album by American alternative metal band Helmet, released in 1994 by Interscope Records. It is Helmet's highest charting album in the US.
The album was highly anticipated by both music critics and fans as a result of the band's success with the previous album, Meantime (1992). Rob Echeverria (guitarist of New York hardcore band Rest in Pieces) replaced Peter Mengede on guitar. After recording and touring in support of the album, Echeverria left Helmet in 1995 to join Biohazard; however, his departure was more amicable than Mengede's.
Prior to Betty's release in June 1994, the album's biggest hit, "Milquetoast", appeared in alternate form on The Crow soundtrack as "Milktoast". Its video was in regular rotation on MTV, and videos for "Wilma's Rainbow" and "Biscuits for Smut" were also released. In 2015, the band announced a Betty tour, where they performed the album in its entirety.

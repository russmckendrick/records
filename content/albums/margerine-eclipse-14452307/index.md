It was released on 27 January 2004 in the United States by Elektra Records and on 2 February 2004 in the United Kingdom by Duophonic Records. The album is in large part a eulogy to former band member Mary Hansen, who died in 2002.
By June 2004, Margerine Eclipse had sold over 40,000 copies in the USA. A remastered and expanded edition of the album was released by Duophonic and Warp on 29 November 2019.

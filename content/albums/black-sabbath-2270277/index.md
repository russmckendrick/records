| Catalog Number | R1 1871, 1871 |

180 gram black vinyl Rhino reissue, cut from the original analog masters.  This release is very similar to the 1970 Warner Bros. Records release [r=2011391]. "Rhino Vinyl" is only mentioned in a small font on the vinyl labels. The reissue year 2010 is not visible anywhere; only 1970. Record housed in plain poly-lined inner sleeve. Barcode appears only on hype sticker.  Jacket is Tip-On.  Made in U.S.A. on labels. Printed in U.S.A. on spine.  This release is not to be confused with the nearly identical [r=7286544] which has different center labels.

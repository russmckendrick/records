Hello! is the sixth studio album by the British rock band Status Quo. Released in September 1973, it was the first of four Status Quo albums to top the UK Albums Chart. 
Keyboard player Andy Bown and saxophonists Stewart Blandamer and Steve Farr played on "Blue Eyed Lady".  This was Bown's first appearance on a Status Quo album; he guested on several subsequent releases, and became an official member of the band in 1981. Blandamer and Farr also played on "Forty Five Hundred Times", which featured piano by John Mealing.
It was the first Status Quo album on which drummer John Coghlan was credited with songwriting, although Francis Rossi has said in an interview that the credit was given to Coghlan by himself and his co-writer, Bob Young, at the request of their management to even out songwriting royalty income, with "Roll Over Lay Down" and "Softer Ride" both having been in fact been written by Rossi and Young but the credit being shared or given to others.

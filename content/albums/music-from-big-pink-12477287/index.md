Music from Big Pink is the debut studio album by Canadian-American rock band the Band. Released on July 1, 1968, by Capitol Records, it employs a distinctive blend of country, rock, folk, classical, R&B, blues, and soul. The album's title refers to a house in West Saugerties, New York called "Big Pink", which was shared by bassist/singer Rick Danko, pianist/singer Richard Manuel and organist Garth Hudson and in which the album's music was partly composed. The album itself was recorded in studios in New York and Los Angeles in 1968, and followed the band's stint backing of Bob Dylan on his 1966 tour (as the Hawks) and time spent together in upstate New York recording material that was officially released in 1975 as The Basement Tapes, also with Dylan. The cover artwork is a painting by Dylan.
In 2000, the album was rereleased with additional outtakes from the recording sessions, and in 2018, a "50th Anniversary Super Deluxe" edition was released with a new stereo mix by Bob Clearmountain.

Good Fortune is an upcoming American comedy film written and directed by Aziz Ansari in his feature directorial debut. Keanu Reeves stars alongside Ansari, Seth Rogen, Keke Palmer and Sandra Oh. It is produced by Ansari's company Oh Brudder Productions. It follows an angel named Gabriel (Reeves), whose failed attempt to show a struggling man (Ansari) that money doesn't solve one's problems—by body swapping him with his wealthy employer Jeff (Rogen)—results in Gabriel losing his wings, while the work he did as an angel begins to unravel around them. 
After the suspension of his original directorial debut Being Mortal at Searchlight Pictures in 2022, Ansari moved forward with plans to direct Good Fortune. He desired to make a comedy film with the intent for it to be theatrically released, citing the success of Barbie (2023) as proof of the viability of such a project. Ansari's longtime friend Rogen, who inspired the implementation of several elements into the film, joined alongside Reeves in April 2023, when the film was set to begin principal photography in May. Following a production shutdown in the middle of the month due to the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike, filming started in late January 2024 in Los Angeles, when Palmer joined the cast. The majority of filming wrapped before April 2024, with some scenes picked up at a later date after an injury Reeves sustained two weeks into filming had healed.
Good Fortune is scheduled to be released in the United States on October 17, 2025.

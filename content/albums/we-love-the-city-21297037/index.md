We Love the City is the third album by British indie rock band Hefner.  It was released by Too Pure in two formats in 2000, the standard version and a second version with a disc featuring videos for "I Took Her Love for Granted" and "Good Fruit," as well as a John Peel session.  The entire John Peel session was later released as the album Maida Vale.  The album was reissued in 2009.
The album features vocals on a number of tracks by Amelia Fletcher, who is the vocalist for a number of bands (Marine Research, Heavenly, Talulah Gosh). This was the first Hefner LP to feature Jack Hayter as a permanent member.
Darren Hayman, lead singer and songwriter, has described We Love the City as his "favourite Hefner record".

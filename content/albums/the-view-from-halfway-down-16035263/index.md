"The View from Halfway Down" is the fifteenth episode of the sixth season of the American animated television series BoJack Horseman, and the 75th and penultimate episode of the series overall. Written by Alison Tafel and directed by Amy Winfrey, the episode was released on Netflix on January 31, 2020,  alongside the second half of the sixth and final season. Guest stars in this episode include Stanley Tucci, Kristen Schaal, Wendie Malick, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Brandon T. Jackson, and Zach Braff.
In the episode, BoJack Horseman (Will Arnett) attends a dinner party and talent show hosted by his late mother Beatrice (Malick) and attended by various other characters that have died during the series, including his former Horsin' Around co-star Sarah Lynn (Schaal), his best friend Herb Kazzaz (Tucci), and a combination of his father Butterscotch and his childhood role-model Secretariat (also voiced by Arnett). Part-way into the episode, BoJack realizes that he is in limbo, his body lying face-down in his old swimming-pool.
"The View from Halfway Down" was widely acclaimed by television critics, who praised its ambitious concept, dark and serious tone, and function as the culmination of the title-character's story. The episode received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Animated Program.

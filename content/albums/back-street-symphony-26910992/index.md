Backstreet Symphony is the debut studio album by English hard rock band Thunder. Recorded in 1989 at Great Linford Manor Studios in Milton Keynes, it was produced by former Duran Duran and The Power Station guitarist Andy Taylor, then mixed by Mike Fraser at AIR Studios in London. The album was initially released on 5 March 1990 by EMI Records in the UK and Capitol Records in the US, and was later re-released the following year in the US by Geffen Records.
The material on Backstreet Symphony was written primarily by the band's lead guitarist Luke Morley, with two songs co-written by Taylor and one cover version included. The album received positive reviews from a number of critics and peaked at number 21 on the UK Albums Chart, receiving a gold certification from the British Phonographic Industry for sales in excess of 100,000 units. Upon its 1991 re-release, the album registered at number 114 on the US Billboard 200.
Backstreet Symphony was promoted on a worldwide tour beginning in February 1990, which included shows in Europe supporting Heart, Love/Hate and ZZ Top, as well as dates in North America. Five singles were released from the album, all of which reached the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart â€“ "Dirty Love" peaked at number 32, "Backstreet Symphony" at number 25, "Gimme Some Lovin'" at number 36, "She's So Fine" at number 34 and "Love Walked In" at number 21.

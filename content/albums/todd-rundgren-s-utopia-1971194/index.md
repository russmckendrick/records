Todd Rundgren's Utopia is the debut album by the American rock band Utopia, released on October 4, 1974 on Bearsville Records. The band was formed in 1973 by musician, songwriter, and producer Todd Rundgren who decided to expand his musical style by moving from pop-oriented rock towards progressive rock. He assembled a six-piece group that featured three keyboardists and toured as a live act. Most of the album was recorded in the studio except "Utopia", the opening track, which was recorded live in concert April 25th, 1974.
The album peaked at number 34 on the Billboard 200 and critical reaction towards it was mixed.

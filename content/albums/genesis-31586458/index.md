Genesis is the twelfth studio album by English rock band Genesis, released on 3 October 1983 by Charisma and Virgin Records in the UK and by Atlantic Records in the US and Canada. Following the band's tour in support of their 1982 live album Three Sides Live, Genesis took an eight-month break before they regrouped in the spring of 1983 to record a new album. It is their first written and recorded in its entirety at their studio named The Farm in Chiddingfold, Surrey, and the songs were developed through jam sessions in the studio with nothing written beforehand. Hugh Padgham returned as their engineer.
Genesis was the group's greatest commercial success at the time of release, becoming the band's third straight album to reach No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart. It also reached No. 9 on the US Billboard 200, where it sold over 4 million copies. Five singles were released between 1983 and 1984; "Mama" was the lead single and remains the highest charting Genesis single in the UK, reaching No. 4. While "Mama" stalled on the US charts, follow-up single "That's All" reached No. 6 there and became the band's first US top 10 hit. The band toured the album in 1983 and 1984, recordings from which formed the concert video Genesis Live: The Mama Tour. In 1985, the album received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and "Second Home by the Sea" was nominated for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. In 2007, the album was re-released with new stereo and 5.1 surround sound mixes.

I Just Can't Stop It is the debut studio album by British two-tone band the Beat, released on 23 May 1980 by Go-Feet Records in the United Kingdom. It was released the same year in the United States on Sire Records, with the band credited as "The English Beat"; in Australia, it was released on Go-Feet under the band name "The British Beat".
The album was well-received; Rolling Stone raved that the music was "wild and threatening, sexy and sharp," while AllMusic later wrote it "was a stunning achievement" which had not been diminished by time.
The album was reissued on CD in 1990 by I.R.S. Records in the U.S, and in 2012 by Edsel Records in the UK and Shout! Factory in the U.S.

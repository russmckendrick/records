Runouts are etched, except 5845431 which is stamped and scratched out.

Labels on this release show 2.75" outer pressing ring with 1.375" inner pressing ring (characteristic of the Tracy-Val Hamilton presses formerly owned by [url=https://www.discogs.com/label/264205-Hub-Servall-Record-Mfg-Corp]Hub Servall[/url] and acquired by [url=https://www.discogs.com/label/1026890-Independent-Record-Pressing?page=1&genre=All&limit=500]Independent Record Pressing[/url] in 2015, as noted in Hub-Servall profile). [r=8755897] has similar runouts with stamped and scratched out 5845431 and the same [url=https://www.discogs.com/label/313190-Optimal-Media-GmbH]Optimal Media[/url] plating number but the labels of that release have only a single pressing ring.

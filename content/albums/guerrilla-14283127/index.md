Guerrilla warfare is a form of unconventional warfare in which small groups of irregular military, such as  rebels, partisans, paramilitary personnel or armed civilians, including recruited children, use ambushes, sabotage, terrorism, raids, petty warfare or hit-and-run tactics in a rebellion, in a violent conflict, in a war or in a civil war to fight against regular military, police or rival insurgent forces.
Although the term "guerrilla warfare" was coined in the context of the Peninsular War in the 19th century, the tactical methods of guerrilla warfare have long been in use. In the 6th century BC, Sun Tzu proposed the use of guerrilla-style tactics in The Art of War. The 3rd century BC Roman general Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus is also credited with inventing many of the tactics of guerrilla warfare through what is today called the Fabian strategy, and in China Peng Yue is also often regarded as the inventor of guerrilla warfare. Guerrilla warfare has been used by various factions throughout history and is particularly associated with revolutionary movements and popular resistance against invading or occupying armies.
Guerrilla tactics focus on avoiding head-on confrontations with enemy armies, typically due to inferior arms or forces, and instead engage in limited skirmishes with the goal of exhausting adversaries and forcing them to withdraw (see also attrition warfare). Organized guerrilla groups often depend on the support of either the local population or foreign backers who sympathize with the guerrilla group's efforts.

| Label          | BMG |
| Catalog Number | BMGCAT392DLP |
| Notes | 20th Anniversary Edition.<br>Pop-up Gatefold Double LP.<br>Remastered From The Original Master Tapes. <br><br>A5 plays from the inside out after the main tracks on side A and ends in a locked groove that separates A1-A4 from it.  It is not listed on the sleeve, which follows the tradition of the Easter egg concept as it was a hidden track on the original CD release found by rewinding the first track.  <br><br>B2 and C1 are longer than the original and deluxe CD, vinyl and digital releases as the segue was broken with the vinyl being split into four parts.  <br><br>Side B ends in a locked groove just before the run-out. The run-out has no groove in it.<br><br>There is also a reprise version of D3 after D4, which wasn't on the original vinyl release and is also not listed on this release.  <br><br>Durations not printed on release.  <br><br>There is no side A matrix / runout; it's absence here is not by error. |

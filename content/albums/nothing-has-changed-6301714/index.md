Nothing Has Changed (stylised as Nothing has changed.) is a compilation album by English musician David Bowie. It was released on 18 November 2014 through Parlophone in the United Kingdom, and Columbia Records and Legacy Recordings in the United States. The album was released in four formats: a triple CD version (sequenced in reverse chronological order), a double CD version (sequenced in chronological order), a double LP version, and a single CD version released exclusive to select countries.
It is the first album to showcase Bowie's entire career up to that point, from his first single "Liza Jane" in 1964 to "Sue (Or in a Season of Crime)", a new composition recorded specifically for the compilation. The different formats of the album all offer different tracks and mixes compared to the others. The three-disc version includes the most, such as songs from Bowie's unreleased 2001 album Toy. The collection also contains numerous discrepancies in its track listings. Its title comes from a lyric in the song "Sunday" from Bowie's 2002 album Heathen. Each of the different formats feature different cover artworks, all designed by Jonathan Barnbrook and all depicting Bowie examining himself in a mirror.
Upon its release, the album debuted at number nine in the UK, becoming Bowie's 29th top 10 album. Following Bowie's death in 2016, it went on to peak at number five in the UK and charted in other countries. It has been certified Gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in the UK. The three-disc version of Nothing Has Changed received critical acclaim, with many praising its reverse sequencing as offering a different way to enjoy the artist's career. However, it attracted criticism for its exclusion of Bowie's Tin Machine period, as well as its under-representation of the Berlin Trilogy (1977–1979). Nevertheless, it is considered one of Bowie's best compilation albums.
A revised version of the two-disc Nothing Has Changed, re-titled Legacy, was released on 11 November 2016 and includes selections from his final album Blackstar (2016).

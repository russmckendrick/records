Marbles is the 13th studio album from rock band Marillion, released in 2004. Unlike their previous studio album, Anoraknophobia (2001), which was financed largely by a preorder campaign, the band funded the recording, and it was the publicity campaign that fans financed for the album. Those fans who pre-ordered the album received an exclusive 2-CD "Deluxe Campaign Edition" with a booklet containing the names of everyone who pre-ordered before a certain date. The public release date of the retail single-CD version of the album was 3 May 2004 while a plain 2-CD version was made available from the band's website. A limited (500 copy) edition was released on white multicoloured vinyl by Racket Records on 13 November 2006.
In 2011, the 2-CD version became available as a  retail edition in a mediabook by the Madfish label, reissued in 2017 as a simpler digipak edition. Madfish also released the full album on vinyl for the first time, occupying three LPs. Another reissue of the CD appeared in 2021 on Kscope.
The album did not chart in the UK, due to it being packaged with a couple of stickers, which is against chart rules.  So despite selling enough for a top 30 position, the album was declared ineligible for the album chart; however, its first single "You're Gone", reached #7 in the UK Singles Chart, thus becoming their first UK top ten hit since 1987's "Incommunicado". The follow-up single "Don't Hurt Yourself" peaked at #16. Classic Rock ranked Marbles #11 on their end-of-year list for 2004. The album is ranked at #53 on Prog Magazine's list of the Top 100 Prog Albums of All Time.

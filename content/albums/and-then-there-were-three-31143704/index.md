...And Then There Were Three... (stylised in all lowercase) is the ninth studio album by the English rock band Genesis. It was released on 31 March 1978 by Charisma Records and is their first recorded as a trio of singer/drummer Phil Collins, keyboardist Tony Banks, and bassist/guitarist Mike Rutherford, following the departure of guitarist Steve Hackett. The album marked a shift in the band's sound, mixing elements of their progressive rock roots with more accessible material, and Collins contributing to more of the group's songwriting.
The album received mixed reviews from critics, but reached No. 3 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 14 on the US Billboard 200. The lead single "Follow You Follow Me" became their highest charting at that point, reaching No. 7 in the UK and No. 23 in the US. The album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1988 for selling one million copies in the US. To further promote it, Genesis toured worldwide with live guitarist Daryl Stuermer and drummer Chester Thompson, both of whom would become mainstays of the band's touring lineup for the next three decades. The album was remixed in 2007 as part of the Genesis 1976–1982 box set in 5.1 surround sound and a new stereo mix by Nick Davis.

Soul Men is a 2008 American musical comedy film directed by Malcolm D. Lee, and starring Samuel L. Jackson, Bernie Mac, Sharon Leal and Sean Hayes, released on November 7, 2008. It was one of three Mac's films that were released after his death (and was actually released on the same date as another posthumous film, Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa).
Mac and Isaac Hayes died on August 9 and 10, 2008, respectively.  Director Lee said the film was heavily re-edited to soften the tone of the film, as a tribute to the two actors.
It is the last Weinstein Company film to be distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.
Critical reviews were mixed, and Soul Men was not a financial success.

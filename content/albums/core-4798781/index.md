Core is the debut studio album by the American rock band Stone Temple Pilots, released by Atlantic Records on September 29, 1992.
Produced by Brendan O'Brien, Core became a massive commercial success, reaching number three on the Billboard 200 by July 1993 and has since been certified 8× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album spawned four hit singles including "Sex Type Thing", "Wicked Garden", "Creep", and "Plush": "Plush" would reach number one on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks and the music video received heavy rotation on MTV. Stone Temple Pilots would go on to win two awards for "Plush": an MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist and a Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance.
The album initially received poor reviews despite its commercial success; the band was criticized for allegedly copying the musical style of other alternative acts, particularly Pearl Jam and Nirvana. Retrospectively, Core has been acknowledged as a seminal release of the alternative rock and grunge movement of the early 1990s. Core helped propel Stone Temple Pilots into the mainstream and remains their most commercially successful record. A 25th Anniversary Deluxe Edition was released in 2017.

On the Level is the eighth studio album by English rock band Status Quo, released by Vertigo Records on 14 February 1975. The album's cover art features band members in an Ames room, and on the original vinyl release, the inner gatefold sleeve consisted of informal photos members of the group had taken of each other.
In November 1974, the band released the only single from the album, an edited version of a Rossi/Young song entitled "Down Down". The single gave the band their only number one hit to date. Its b-side was the Parfitt/Young album track "Nightride".
The album entered the UK Albums Chart at number one. All tracks were written or co-written by the group and long-term collaborator Bob Young, apart from "Bye Bye Johnny", which was a Chuck Berry composition.

Waiting is the second and final studio album by English new wave pop band Fun Boy Three, released in 1983 by Chrysalis Records. It featured the hit single "Our Lips Are Sealed", co-written by Terry Hall and previously recorded by the Go-Go's. It was produced by David Byrne.
The album's lead track, "Murder She Said," is a cover of the theme from the four films in the British Miss Marple series, starring Margaret Rutherford, originally released from 1961 to 1964.

Sleep cut ties with their sludge past and dove into neo-Sabbath doom and stoner metal on their landmark album, <i>Sleep’s Holy Mountain</i>. The power trio’s lumbering chugs wander through prehistoric landscapes covered in mountains of fuzz and whirling vocal effects (“Dragonaut”) and continue into shadowy nether realms wherein monk-like chants ride throbbing, meditative riffs (“From Beyond”). Subtle yet incredibly potent doses of blues and funk pop up all over, giving jams like the hazy, psychedelic “Aquarian” a slow and shaggy swing.

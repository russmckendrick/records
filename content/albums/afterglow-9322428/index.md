Afterglow is a compilation album released by Australian-New Zealand rock band Crowded House in 1999. It consists of outtakes, b-sides and other rarities recorded between 1985 and 1995. Seven of the songs were originally recorded for the Woodface album before Tim Finn became involved.
The song "Left Hand" appears on Crowded House's live album Special Edition Live Album. "Help Is Coming" was the first released studio recording to feature drummer and co-writer Peter Jones, and was re-released in 2015 as a charity single for Syrian refugees.  "You Can Touch" was a bonus track for the Japanese edition of Together Alone.

Still Crazy After All These Years is the fourth solo studio album by American singer-songwriter Paul Simon, released on 	October 17, 1975, by Columbia Records. Recorded and released in 1975, the album produced four U.S. Top 40 hits: "50 Ways to Leave Your Lover" (No. 1), "Gone at Last" (No. 23, credited to Paul Simon/Phoebe Snow), "My Little Town" (No. 9, credited to Simon & Garfunkel), and the title track (No. 40). It won two Grammy Awards for Album of the Year and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance in 1976. 
"My Little Town" reunited Simon with former partner Art Garfunkel on record for the first time since 1970, while "Gone at Last" was a duet between Simon and Phoebe Snow.  Two tracks featured members of the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section as a backing band.
The title track has been recorded by Rosemary Clooney (on her 1993 album Still on the Road), Ray Charles (on his 1993 album My World), Karen Carpenter (on her self-titled solo album released posthumously in 1996), Willie Nelson (on the soundtrack of the 2000 motion picture Space Cowboys), and Robert Ellis (on his 2016 self-titled solo album).

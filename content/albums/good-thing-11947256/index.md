On his brilliant 2015 debut album, <I>Coming Home</I>, Texas singer/songwriter Leon Bridges invited comparisons to Sam Cooke and Otis Redding with his authentic take on soul. <I>Good Thing</I>, his 2018 follow-up, finds Bridges leaving the ’50 and ’60s, instead embracing ’70s icons like The Stylistics (“Bet Ain’t Worth the Hand”) and Chic (“You Don’t Know”). More surprises come in “If It Feels Good (Then It Must Be)” and “Bad Bad News”, contemporary jams that show he can swag it out with the likes of Usher and Pharrell too. Bridges' warm tenor is sturdy and smoky as mesquite wood as he combines deep emotions and nimble wordplay on “Beyond”, “Forgive You” and “Georgia to Texas”—a moving story of his family’s history.

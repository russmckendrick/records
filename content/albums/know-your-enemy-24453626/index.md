Know Your Enemy is the sixth studio album by Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers, released on 19 March 2001 by Epic Records. It was supported by four singles, all of which reached the  top 20 of the UK Singles Chart. 
The band originally envisioned Know Your Enemy as two separate albums with very different sounds and concepts, with the intention of releasing both on the same day. However, the record label vetoed the idea and a compromise was made, resulting in a single, lengthy, very diverse record. Whilst the album sold well, it did not match the success of its predecessor, This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours. Critics were somewhat divided in their opinions at first, but its reception since has been more positive.
In 2022, the band released remixed and expanded 2- and 3-disc editions of Know Your Enemy, rearranging the tracks into the two separate albums as originally intended.

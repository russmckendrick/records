Love You to Bits is the seventh studio album by No-Man.
Released as the first album for 11 years after Schoolyard Ghosts (2008), the album consists of two five-part song cycles and has been described as, "Chronicling the aftermath of a relationship from different perspectives". Within the songs, each part is called a "bit" or a "piece". Musically, the album represents a return to the more electronic, beat-driven sound of the band's earliest albums, while also incorporating conceptual and organic elements that echo approaches heard on the band's later releases.
"Love You to Bits" (Bit 1) was released as a single in early November 2019, along with a 13-minute non-album instrumental B-side entitled "Love You to Shreds (Shreds 1–3)".
Produced, written and performed by No-Man and mixed by Bruno Ellingham, former Miles Davis keyboard player Adam Holzman, drummer Ash Soan, The Dave Desmond Brass Quintet, No-Man live bassist Pete Morgan and Slovak Jazz guitarist David Kollar guest.

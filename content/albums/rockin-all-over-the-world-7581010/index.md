Rockin' All Over the World is the tenth studio album by British band Status Quo. It is their first to be produced by Pip Williams. Released in November 1977, it reached #5 in the UK.
"A poxy album," said guitarist and singer Francis Rossi. "There's nothing poxy about Rockin' All Over the World," countered guitarist Rick Parfitt. "It's fucking great. Pip added some class into the production and, from then onwards, we got quite posh – for us." Uncharacteristically, bassist Alan Lancaster agreed with Rossi: "When Pip Williams started producing us was when everything started to go wrong."
The title track, written and originally recorded by John Fogerty, was released as a single in September 1977, peaking at #3 in the UK. Its b-side was "Ring of a Change", from their previous studio album Blue for You. No other singles were issued from the album, although "Can't Give You More" was re-recorded by the band for 1991's Rock 'Til You Drop and issued as a single, reaching #37.
The album was reissued by Mercury in 2005 with a bonus track: a cover of the Beatles' "Getting Better", initially recorded in 1976 for the soundtrack of the film All This and World War II. This track was omitted from a deluxe edition released in late 2015; however, for this reissue, the entire album was remixed and reordered by original engineer John Eden. Several of the new mixes feature longer play-outs and the overall sound was stripped back to the core of two guitars, bass and drums, with occasional keyboard parts. As a further bonus, four demos were included.

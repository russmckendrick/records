Behind the Music is the third album by the Swedish rock band The Soundtrack of Our Lives. It was originally released in Europe in February 2001, and subsequently around the world over the next two years. The album was the band's breakthrough record outside of their native Sweden, and was nominated for the Best Alternative Album award at the 2003 Grammy Awards. Among their newly found fans was Noel Gallagher, who proclaimed Behind the Music to be "the best album to come out in the last six years" and invited The Soundtrack of Our Lives to join on Oasis's UK and European tour in 2002.
The front cover features alginate masks of the faces of the six band members, cast by Swedish artists Per Svensson and Anna Strid. Svensson and the group's frontman Ebbot Lundberg had previously collaborated in an experimental sound and art project called 'Audio Laboratory'.

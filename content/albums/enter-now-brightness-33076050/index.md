Five years between albums has given Nadia Reid plenty to reflect upon across <i>Enter Now Brightness</i>, recorded while she was pregnant with her second child. Besides becoming a mother since 2000’s <i>Out of My Province</i>, the Aotearoa New Zealand songwriter relocated across the world to Manchester, England. So themes of renewal run naturally through these warm, open songs, with Reid backed primarily by guitarist/keyboardist Sam Taylor and multi-instrumentalist/producer Tom Healy. Half of these tracks are quite sparse, while the other half deploy bassist Richard Pickard and drummer Joe McCallum for an effective oomph. Even the more stripped-back tracks aren’t as rooted in folk music as Reid’s earlier work was, but rather in a ruminative strand of indie pop. Whichever mode she’s in, she sings with such calm sureness that it’s easy to get swept up in the emotional truth of her lyrics. As horns lick the edges of the woozy ballad “Baby Bright”, she tells her older daughter, “Something tells me that you’re gonna be all right.” And on “Hold It Up”, Reid sounds downright serene as the arrangements wax and wane around her and she assures us, “I can be kind to anyone.”

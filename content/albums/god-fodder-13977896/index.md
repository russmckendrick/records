God Fodder is the debut studio album by English rock band Ned's Atomic Dustbin, released on 1 April 1991 by Columbia Records. After creating their own imprint following the success of several prior independent singles, the band recorded the album from December 1990 to January 1991 in London. Musically, God Fodder takes large influence from grebo, shoegaze, noise pop, and dance music, characterized by noisy guitars, complex drum beats, and its usage of two bass players, with Matt Cheslin playing regular bass lines and Alex Griffin playing harmonic bass lines. Lyrically, the album features communal efforts written by all the band.
Five different singles were released from God Fodder across different regions. Upon its release, the album was a critical and commercial success, reaching number 4 in the UK Albums Chart; it also found an audience in the United States, where the album reached number 91 on the Billboard 200, largely due to the band's T-shirt campaign and the videos for “Kill Your Television” and "Grey Cell Green", which gained traction on MTV's “120 Minutes Into The Future”. The record's success is said to be a triumph against the dominance of grunge music at the time. The album was named among the year's best albums by several magazines. The band played the album in its entirety for the first time in O2 Shepherd's Bush Empire in December 2009 and played it again in Birmingham in September 2010.

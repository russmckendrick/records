Silver vinyl strictly limited to 100 copies worldwide. Season Of Mist mailorder exclusive.  first cat number appears on spine and label second cat number appears on hype sticker Barcode on hype sticker  Credits state “False Spring” originally performed by Arboretum written by Neumann/Wilson. It is actually by [Arbouretum](https://www.discogs.com/artist/722989-Arbouretum) written by Heumann/Wilson. “The Golden Boy Swallowed By The Sea” originally performed by [Swans](https://www.discogs.com/artist/154588-Swans) “Will-O-The-Wisp” originally performed by [Magnolia Electric Co](https://www.discogs.com/artist/364911-Magnolia-Electric-Co) “Victory” originally performed by No Means No ([Nomeansno](https://www.discogs.com/artist/133641-Nomeansno)) “In Bad Dreams” originally performed by [The God Machine](https://www.discogs.com/artist/278050-The-God-Machine) “The Faith Healer” originally performed by [The Sensational Alex Harvey Band](https://www.discogs.com/artist/426655-The-Sensational-Alex-Harvey-Band)  Eric Mansfield is on the Bandcamp credits as vocals on 'The Faith Healer' and as CBP manager. However he is not credited on the physical release.  James Ray is credited for vocals on the physical release for 'The Faith Healer' but is not on the Bandcamp credits. I believe the Bandcamp page is a typo and James Ray vocalist and therefore not crediting Eric Mansfield for vocals.

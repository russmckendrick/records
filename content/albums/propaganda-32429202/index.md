Propaganda is the fourth studio album by American rock band Sparks, released on November 11, 1974. Following up their commercial breakthrough, Kimono My House, released earlier the same year, it was a moderate success in the United States and peaked at No. 9 in the UK in 1975. The album cover features an image of a tied-up and gagged Mael brothers, titled "Welcome on Board", which was taken by photographer Monty Coles.

Frenzy is the fourth studio album by New Zealand new wave band Split Enz. Frenzy ventured even further beyond the band's art rock roots to more of a pop sound.
The album is notable for being the first to feature Neil Finn on lead vocals – though the lyrics to "Give It a Whirl" and both music & lyrics to "Master Plan" were written by his brother Tim.

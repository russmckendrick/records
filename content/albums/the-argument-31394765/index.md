Recorded in early 2001, and released just after the world began to fall apart that September, <i>The Argument</i> was Fugazi’s final album before going on indefinite hiatus in late 2002. By this point, the band had figured out how to use the studio. And even though the four members of Fugazi had proved to be dynamic live performers—reinventing and re-energising their material on the road—<i>The Argument</i> found them expanding their sound to include elements that couldn’t easily be reproduced onstage: Deeper background vocals, acoustic guitars, even the occasional cello (courtesy of Amy Domingues). Maybe the band members knew their touring days would end soon, and weren’t sweating how <i>The Argument</i> would play live. Or maybe this is just the kind of confidence and skill that naturally results from being one of the greatest rock acts of the late 20th century. 

<i>The Argument</i> gets down to business right away with “Cashout”, a blistering track that rips apart heartless landlords. These guys can still explode when they want to: Guy Picciotto’s scream on “Full Disclosure” (“Iwantout Iwantout Iwantout!”) and Ian MacKaye’s equally anguished cries on “Epic Problem” (“STOPSTOPSTOPSTOP!”) are as sweaty as anything from the band’s late-1980s output. And while the band’s anger is evident on <i>The Argument</i>, fuller musical textures are the rule rather than the exception, as evidenced by “Strangelight”, which might—just <i>might</i>—be a genuinely sensual love song. As for the album’s psychic insight into what late-2001 American life might feel like—well, let’s just say it was downright chilling to hear the lines “Some punk could argue some moral ABCs/When people are catching what bombers release” that winter. 

Still, no line captures the innate ferocity of <i>The Argument</i>—and of Fugazi’s entire career—as the title track, which closes the album. “I’m on a mission to never agree,” MacKaye sings. Few bands have ever embodied “Yeah? BULLSHIT!” as clearly and completely.

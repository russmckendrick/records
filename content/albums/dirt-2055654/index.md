Sticker on shrink wrap reads: "Music On Vinyl  Classic Album  180 gram audiophile vinyl pressing www.musiconvinyl.com"  Different tracklisting than the original release. On original release "Down In A Hole" was the second-to-last track, some later reprints move it to track 4 instead. This vinyl version moves it to track 4, which also means the Side B opener ("Dirt") is instead track B2 and the Side A closer ("Junkhead") is the new Side B opener.  B4 is not listed on the jacket or label.  Includes a printed inner sleeve with lyrics & credits.  [a=Tom Araya] appears courtesy of [l=Def American Records].  Produced at One on One and Eldorado, 1992.  Mixed at Eldorado.  Mastered at Future Disc, Hollywood, CA.

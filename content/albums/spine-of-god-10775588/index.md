Spine of God is the debut studio album by American rock band Monster Magnet, released in Europe in 1991 and in the United States the following year. The album represents one of the earliest examples of the emerging 1990s sub-genre of stoner rock. Spine of God did not perform well commercially upon its initial release, but was praised by critics and would later be considered a major influence on stoner rock bands. The song "Medicine" was released as a single with accompanying music video.

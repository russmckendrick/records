Look to the East, Look to the West is the sixth studio album by the Scottish indie pop band Camera Obscura, released on 3 May 2024 via Merge Records. It is their first album in 11 years and the first since the death of keyboardist and backing vocalist Carey Lander in 2015; Donna Maciocia (formerly a member of Amplifico), who joined the band as a permanent member in 2023, fills out her role. The album is produced by Jari Haapalainen, who previously worked on Let's Get Out of This Country (2006) and My Maudlin Career (2009).

"Swing the Mood" is a song by British novelty pop music act Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers, released as the first single from their debut album, Jive Bunny: The Album (1989). Produced by the father and son DJ team of Andy and John Pickles, "Swing the Mood" is a cut and paste record which fused a number of early rock and roll records with liberal use of Glenn Miller's "In the Mood".
Copyright problems caused a re-recorded version to be released; despite this version being derided by critics, it became a hit in the United Kingdom, spending five weeks at number one on the UK Singles Chart in July and August 1989, partly aided by the Jive Bunny animated character. The record became a worldwide hit as well, topping the charts of 12 other countries and reaching number 11 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It was the second-best-selling single of 1989 in the UK.

Foxtrot is the fourth studio album by the English progressive rock band Genesis, released on 15 September 1972 on Charisma Records. It features their longest recorded song, the 23-minute track "Supper's Ready".
The album was recorded during the tour in support of their previous album, Nursery Cryme (1971), which saw them gain popularity, including a well-received slot at the Great Western Festival, Lincolnshire, in May 1972. The album was written over the summer of 1972 and combined songs that had already been performed live with new material worked out in jam sessions. Recording began in August with Bob Potter as producer, but sessions were prone to tension and disagreements. After a short Italian tour, sessions resumed with Dave Hitchcock as producer. The cover was the final one designed by Paul Whitehead, featuring a fox wearing a red dress. Frontman, Peter Gabriel, wore the dress and a fox's head on stage during the following tour, which gathered press attention and raised the group's profile.
Foxtrot was the first Genesis album to chart in the UK, reaching No. 12, and received largely positive reviews. It reached No. 15 in Italy, where the band had been popular for some time. The album has continued to attract critical praise and was reissued with a new stereo and 5.1 surround sound mix as part of their 2008 Genesis 1970–1975 box set.

ID.Entity is the eighth studio album by Polish progressive rock band Riverside, released on January 20, 2023, by Inside Out Music and Mystic Production and was produced by bassist Mariusz Duda. The album peaked at #2 in Poland and #4 in Germany. It is the first album to feature lead guitarist Maciej Meller as a full member, who had replaced Piotr Grudziński  (following his death in 2016) as a touring member in 2017 before joining the band as a full member in 2020. Meller was featured on Wasteland, but only as a guest. The cover was created by Polish artist Jarek Kubicki. The first single "I'm Done With You", was released on October 21, 2022, along with a music video. The tracks "Self-Aware" and "Friend or Foe?" would be released as singles in November and January respectively.

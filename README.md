# Records 🎵

Welcome to the Records repository! This is the source code for [McKendrick Rocks](https://www.mckendrick.rocks/), a site dedicated to showcasing my personal record collection. 🎼🔥

## Overview 🌐

This site was built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and flexible static site generator. The theme was adapted from the beautiful [Forty theme](https://html5up.net/) by HTML5 UP. The content on this site is scraped from [Discogs](http://discogs.com/), an online database and marketplace for music enthusiasts. 📀💿

## Repository Structure 📁

- `config.toml`: Hugo configuration file 🛠
- `content`: Contains the Markdown files with the site's content 📚

## Scraper 🐍

The Python script used to scrape the content from Discogs can be found at [russmckendrick/discogs-scraper](https://github.com/russmckendrick/discogs-scraper/). Be sure to check it out if you're interested in how the data was collected. 🧐

## My Discogs Collection 💽

You can view my personal Discogs collection, the source for the site, [here](http://discogs.com/user/russmck/collection/). But, you should really just goto [McKendrick Rocks](https://www.mckendrick.rocks/) and view it there! 🎧🎶

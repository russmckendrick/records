# Session Notes - December 28, 2025

## Current Status: Hugo Site with Retro Theme Implementation

### Major Work Completed This Session

#### 1. **Theme View System Implementation** ✅
- **Terminal Theme (80s)**: List views only - removed card view switching
- **Modern Theme**: Cards views only - removed list view switching  
- **CSS-driven approach**: Views controlled by `[data-era="80s"]` and `[data-era="modern"]` selectors
- **No JavaScript switching**: Simplified codebase by removing view toggle logic

#### 2. **Homepage Layout Fixes** ✅
- **Added comprehensive padding**: 2rem desktop, 1rem tablet, 0.5rem mobile across all sections
- **Removed "LATEST ADDITIONS" header**: Cleaner interface
- **Fixed CSS class conflicts**: Changed conflicting `album-title` usage to `db-album-name` in list views

#### 3. **Album Detail Page Metadata Layout** ✅
- **Resolved CSS specificity conflicts**: Multiple `.album-meta` rules were overriding each other
- **Fixed grid layout**: Proper 2×2 + 1 spanning layout for metadata boxes
  - Row 1: Release Date, Added
  - Row 2: Record ID, Genre  
  - Row 3: Style (spans both columns)
- **Scoped conflicting rules**: Made card-specific rules use `.album-card .album-meta`

#### 4. **Hugo Image Processing Implementation** ✅
- **Artist List Page**: 400x400px (desktop) + 200x200px (mobile) with WebP conversion
- **Artist Detail Page**: 600x600px + 400x400px + 300x300px responsive sizes
- **Performance impact**: 4,480 images processed during build
- **Responsive images**: Proper `srcset` and `sizes` attributes
- **Fallback handling**: Graceful degradation if image processing fails

## Current Architecture

### Theme Structure
```
themes/retro/
├── layouts/
│   ├── index.html                    # Homepage with forced theme views
│   ├── artist/list.html             # Artist listing + detail (conditional)
│   ├── _default/single.html         # Album detail pages
│   └── partials/
│       ├── artist-detail.html       # Artist detail component
│       ├── album-list-view.html     # Database-style list view
│       └── album-cards-view.html    # Card grid view
└── assets/sass/components/
    ├── _album-detail.scss           # Album page styles with fixed metadata grid
    ├── _homepage.scss               # Homepage styles with theme-specific views
    └── _pages.scss                  # General page styles with scoped conflicts
```

### CSS Architecture
- **Modular SCSS**: Each component in separate files
- **Theme-specific rules**: `[data-era="80s"]` and `[data-era="modern"]` selectors
- **Conflict resolution**: Specific scoping prevents rule collisions
- **Grid layouts**: Proper CSS Grid implementation for metadata boxes

### Hugo Features Utilized
- **Image Processing**: `.Resize()` with WebP conversion and responsive images
- **Resource Management**: `.Resources.GetMatch()` for page-specific assets
- **Conditional Logic**: Template conditionals for different page types
- **Menu Integration**: Hugo menu system for navigation

## Technical Decisions Made

1. **CSS over JavaScript**: Theme views controlled by CSS selectors rather than JS switching
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Image processing with fallbacks for reliability
3. **Responsive-first**: Mobile-first breakpoints and image sizing
4. **Specificity Management**: Scoped CSS rules to prevent conflicts
5. **Build-time Optimization**: Hugo processes images at build time for performance

## Known Issues Resolved
- ✅ Terminal theme showing card views (fixed with CSS forcing)
- ✅ Modern theme showing list views (fixed with CSS forcing)
- ✅ Homepage content hitting edges (fixed with responsive padding)
- ✅ Album metadata in single row (fixed CSS grid specificity)
- ✅ CSS class conflicts between headers and list items (renamed classes)
- ✅ Unoptimized artist images (implemented Hugo image processing)

## Development Environment
- **Hugo Version**: v0.147.7+extended+withdeploy
- **Current Branch**: `retro`
- **Build Status**: Successfully building with 5,838 pages and 4,480 processed images
- **Theme**: Retro terminal/desktop with 80s/90s era switching

## Next Session Priorities
1. **Remove "SQL" references**: Update search interface for modern view - remove terminal/database language
2. **Review remaining pages**: Check Genres, Styles, and Stats pages for theme consistency
3. **Add real-time search**: Implement live search functionality across the site
4. **Review SEO**: Audit and optimize SEO implementation across all pages
5. **Testing**: Verify image processing performance and fallbacks
6. **Mobile optimization**: Test responsive behavior across devices
7. **Performance audit**: Monitor build times and image optimization benefits
8. **Cross-browser testing**: Ensure CSS Grid and image processing work universally
9. **Consider album cover optimization**: Evaluate if homepage thumbnails need processing
